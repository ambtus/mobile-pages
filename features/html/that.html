Turns, halfway to his next meeting, with the looming dread of another session in the Senate beginning soon, with Breha more visibly worn with each year and Leia sharper and angrier, and comes to a halt when he sees one of his aides sprinting up the hallway.</p><p>“Your Highness!” she cries. “The Death Star just entered the system! It’s preparing to fire, we can't—”</p><p>The ground lurches, throwing Bail right off his feet as the whole palace buckles, and he never has time to hit the ground.</p><p>Alderaan vanishes around him in fire and light and a snap-surge terror that rises from a billion throats, and then—</p><p>Just Leia in the darkness, screaming, as vivid and furious as a sun. Bail turns to look for her, a parent’s terror rising even in the midst of the confusion, and reaches—</p><p>Sees her, just for one second, with Vader gripping her shoulder to hold her still. Bail has never been a violent man, but in that moment his only thought is to tear Vader away, remove his hands, remove Leia from anything that might hurt her no matter the cost.</p><p>And then, even shaken, even wild with grief, Leia looks up. Her eyes find him, deep in the strange darkness, and something kindles.</p><p>Twin stars burn to life, and Bail feels their light like a blow, like a hand, like a <em>wrench</em>. He falls, and they tumble after him through the darkness, then right out the other side.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>It feels, unflatteringly, like being seventeen again, overindulging and regretting it. Bail’s whole head throbs, and there's an unpleasant knot in his stomach that could turn into nausea if he moves too fast. Bail’s whole body feels sore, compressed and stretched-out and overused, and he strangles a groan, face-down on dirty duracrete that reeks like Coruscant's lowest levels.</p><p>And then, loud, <em>familiar</em>, a voice says, “Let me <em>go</em>, that’s my father!”</p><p>Leia, Bail thinks, and the alarm that jolts through him is vicious and sharp-edged and draws blood. He thinks of Vader with his hands on Leia, of Leia being tortured by the man who fathered her in the barest senses of the word and then murdered her mother, and he rolls up before he can even begin to think better of it. There's a taste of ashes in his mouth, light-spots burned into his vision, and he can't quite make it to his feet before the world lurches and hands grab him.</p><p>Not Imperial hands. Careful, a little wary in how they hold, but they keep Bail upright on his knees as the world swims, and he gets a hand up, braces himself on slick-smooth armor and goes still, realizing there's a stormtrooper bare inches away from him.</p><p>“Let <em>go</em>!” Leia snarls, and there's a rush, a blur of white that’s stopped halfway.</p><p>“Just <em>wait</em>, lady,” a voice says, modulated through a helmet, and Bail closes his eyes, tries to steady his breathing. He isn't carrying a blaster; Alderaan is a peaceful world, with weapons few and far between, and since Padmé—</p><p>Bail’s breath hitches, shakes out of him. Vader had Leia, and all Bail can think of is Padmé’s still body with bruises all around her throat.</p><p>“Take a minute,” a terse voice says, right up close to him. No helmet, but—the voice is familiar. Familiar in a way that makes something still, deep down in Bail’s chest. He looks up—</p><p>Coruscant Guard red, but not the uniform, identical red of the stormtroopers assigned there. <em>Clone</em> Guard red, no two sets of paint alike, and the man watching him from bare inches away has Jango Fett's face, young and lined with care but not with the accelerated age of every clone trooper Bail has seen.</p><p>The paint is familiar, too, just as much so as his face, and Bail <em>knows</em> this man is years dead, mourned him and what he had once been, but—</p><p>“Commander Fox,” he says, dazed, because there's no broken neck, no windpipe crushed by Darth Vader's grip, none of the scars Fox gained murdering Jedi after the Empire’s rise.</p><p>This is a man lost almost twenty years ago, reappeared like a ghost in the wake of Alderaan’s destruction, and Bail has no idea what’s going on.</p><p>Fox frowns faintly, but inclines his head in one sharp nod. “Yes, sir. Is this girl with you?”</p><p>Shock jars through the bewilderment, and Bail is reaching before Fox even finishes, leaning, seeking. “Leia,” he says, pure relief, and she’s <em>alive</em>, her throat not crushed, her mind not destroyed by Vader. Her eyes lock on his with all the fire she’s always had, the impossible relief in her tangible, and she lunges. The clone commander holding her lets go, and without hesitation she hurls herself across the stretch of stone and right into Bail, crashing headlong into him like a battering ram. Bail’s heart lurches in his chest, and with a sound of relief he wraps his arms around her, presses his cheek to her hair and closes his eyes.</p><p>“Leia,” he says, caught up in his throat, and thinks of the Death Star, of Vader. “He hurt you, are you—”</p><p>“I'm <em>fine</em>,” Leia says, but the way her fingers dig into his back, knot in his cloak and pull like she’s a small child again proves that to be a lie. “I'm fine, Dad, but you—”</p><p>“Shh,” Bail murmurs, before she can say anything about the Death Star or the Empire. Fox is right next to him, and the clones were—</p><p>Well. The clones were one thing for the entirety of the war, and the moment the Jedi were declared traitors they became something else entirely. Bail doesn’t know what to believe, doesn’t even know what this <em>is</em>, but caution won't hurt.</p><p>“Shh, it’s all right now, I'm fine,” Bail says quietly, and Leia trembles, clutches at him, buries her face in his shoulder. Still just nineteen, for all her fire, Bail thinks, and breathes out. But—safe, now. Vader doesn’t have her, and whatever happens, Bail will never let him lay hands on her again.</p><p>“I <em>felt</em> it,” Leia says, low and raw and <em>angry</em>. “I felt them all screaming, and then they stopped. Then <em>you</em> stopped.”</p><p>Bail saw the reports of Jedha, of Scarif. He knows that the Death Star was a world-ender in the way of the ancient Sith, and it turns his stomach to think of all of Alderaan, erased before that blast. Turns his stomach to think of Breha gone, vanished in one burst of light and heat along with all of their people, and Leia watching, helpless in a monster’s grasp. They used it against her, Bail is sure; Tarkin wouldn’t let the opportunity pass, and Vader certainly wouldn’t hesitate.</p><p>“I'm here,” he says, helpless to offer anything else. A Jedi’s senses aren’t something he’s ever dealt with, and Leia has mostly avoided huge bursts of power, has mostly channeled herself into motion and righteousness and fighting the Empire, but—some things would leak through even her control, and the end of several billion lives is one of them, Bail is sure.</p><p>Beside him, there's a shift that makes Leia stiffen, and Fox sits back a little, still cautious, but with a touch of humor in the slant of his mouth. Even before his death, Bail had stopped seeing any signs of life in his face, and seeing this one now is almost jarring.</p><p>“Guess you do know her,” Fox says, and reaches out. He gets a hand under Bail’s elbow, and Bail catches Leia's hand before she can wrench Fox’s away. “Sorry, sir, we’ve got a couple of senators coming through and need this area cleared. Can you stand?”</p><p>Senators. Not <em>other</em> senators, Bail thinks, and wonders what it means that he hasn’t been recognized, that Leia hasn’t either. Wonders what it means that Fox is here, when Bail <em>knows</em> that he died.</p><p>Of course, Bail isn't entirely sure what happened, since he’s entirely certain that he died as well. The Death Star fired. There’s no surviving that.</p><p>“I believe so,” he says, and when Leia untangles herself enough to pull back and look at him, he smiles crookedly at her. “Forgive us for blocking the way, Commander.”</p><p>Leia's eyes narrow for a second before her expression eases, and she rises quickly, catches Bail’s other arm. “Yes, forgive us,” she says, perfectly sweet, and Bail hides his amusement as he lets Leia and Fox help him to his feet. His head still spins a little, but when Leia slides under his arm to brace him, he manages a few steps back towards the railing of the walkway and leans there instead, catching his breath.</p><p>“Not your fault,” Fox says, and he’s still holding onto Bail’s elbow, but he jerks his head at the other commander, who nods sharply and keeps moving, waving a whole squad of the Guard forward along with him. They hurry on, and Bail can hear steps retreating, realizes belatedly that there's no hum of speeder traffic even though this is unmistakably one of the lower levels of Coruscant. Bail spent enough time being dragged through them by Padmé whenever she decided to get into trouble to know them by sight.</p><p>Cleared, Bail thinks, and closes his eyes, trying to think. They're moving senators through the lower levels. Something must have happened.</p><p>“Were you attacked? I can get you a medic,” Fox says, and the care, even in the middle of a mission, makes sense in light of that. Worried about potential enemies along the route, Bail thinks, and breathes out. He needs to get Leia away. He needs to get them somewhere safe and try to figure out what’s going on.</p><p>“We just woke up here,” Leia says without hesitation. “I think someone was trying to kidnap my father, and you must have startled them, Commander. So much that they just dropped us and ran.”</p><p>It is, Bail thinks with some amusement, a better story than what he was thinking of. “I don’t remember how we got here,” he agrees, and it’s entirely the truth. With a sigh, he drags a hand through his hair, tips his head back, and feels Leia tighten her grip on him. When he presses a hand over hers, trying to soothe, she turns her palm over, laces their fingers, and squeezes tightly.</p><p>So much like Breha, Bail thinks, and—he wasn’t even with Breha when the Death Star fired. She was working, and he was elsewhere, and the last thing he said to her was <em>don’t push the trade minister out the window, love</em>.</p><p>Not the epic last words of a doomed love, Bail thinks, grimly amused. But—she knew what was beneath the joke. She always does. Did.</p><p>Did, except that Fox is here, alive, and something has gone very, very wrong.</p><p>Fox gives Leia a narrow look, then shifts his gaze to Bail. “Did you see who abducted you?” he asks, without pressing the matter.</p><p>It’s a little petty, but— “A tall man,” Bail says without even a moment of hesitation. “With rather wavy dark blond hair and a scar at the edge of one eye. The right, I think. Blue eyes, and he wore black and had a prosthetic arm on his right side.”</p><p>Fox raises a brow, but he doesn’t comment on that either. Activates his comm, types in a note, and then nods once. “If you give me your comm code, I’ll send a squad to follow up,” he says. “If you want me to transfer you to a Guard medic, I’ll have one of my men take you up to our nearest staging point.”</p><p>Bail hesitates, not sure which option to take, but before he has to decide Leia says, “I’ll just take my father home, Commander. You’ve helped more than enough, thank you.”</p><p>“All right,” Fox says, though that earns them another careful glance. “Name and comm code?”</p><p>“Bail,” Bail says, because it’s a common name on Alderaan, and no one will mistake their accents for anything else. “Bail Antilles.”</p><p>It’s a nondescript enough name that Fox doesn’t even blink, just takes it down, then the code Bail gives him. Bail has half a moment to wonder if it will actually work in this sideways world, but—he supposes as long as Fox lets them go, it doesn’t matter.</p><p>But—</p><p>“Commander,” he says quietly, and can't help but grip Leia's hand just a little more tightly as Fox raises his gaze from his notes, one brow lifted. A clear gaze, perfectly steady, nothing at all like the bland, oddly subdued man he became after the Empire rose and before Vader murdered him. It makes something turn over in Bail’s chest, something that might be hope or might be fear or might be something halfway between them. And it gives him the courage to ask, “Have you seen Vader recently?”</p><p>“Who?” Fox asks, frowning, and under Bail’s arm Leia goes wire-tense, her grip turning bruising. “Is that the man who abducted you?”</p><p>No recognition. Bail’s heart lurches in his chest, and he has to swallow before he can say, “I think it may be, yes. Forgive me, Commander, my thoughts are rather blurred right now.”</p><p>“Of course, sir.” Fox’s frown doesn’t abate, but a beep from his comm distracts him, and he steps back, hauling his helmet on and then turning away, raising his wrist. “This is Fox.”</p><p>“Sir, we’re at the edge of the perimeter, and Senator Amidala is asking how soon we can proceed,” a voice says.</p><p>Bail’s breath knots up in his lungs, as tight as a fist, and it feels like the world spins out from under his feet for one lurching, wrenching second. Amidala is a name that only one person carries, and that’s—</p><p>“Tell the senator we need another ten minutes,” Fox says, and then glances back. “Do you two need help getting back to the surface?”</p><p>“We’ll be all right, Commander, thank you,” Leia says, her smile perfectly polite, but her grip is hard as she pulls Bail back towards one of the connecting walkways, where a Guard with scales painted on his armor steps back to let them pass. Fox inclines his head, then turns away, already speaking in low tones into his comm, and Bail forces himself to move as quickly as he can, tugging Leia along with him as they hurry up the walkway towards the main street.</p><p>“Dad?” Leia asks, low, but Bail knows how much better clone ears are than baseline Human, the added edge the helmet speakers give them on top of that, and he grips her hand, maybe exaggerates his stumble slightly as they make it to the stairs.</p><p>“Forgive me, Leia, I can't quite catch my breath,” he says, and Leia clearly knows it’s a front, but she nods, reaching up to pull her hood up over her hair. The white of her dress is too bright in the dark undercity, makes Bail’s skin itch in the way that sneaking around with Padmé once did, and he breathes carefully, tries to orient himself.</p><p>“Coruscant is such a maze,” Leia says, a quiet but bitter complaint, and turns him towards a wide opening. Beyond it there’s a hum of speeders, a current of slightly fresher air, a public lift, and Bail takes in the numbers on the side of it but can't place them.</p><p>“Up,” he says. “As high as we can go.”</p><p>Leia nods tightly, pausing at the edge of the opening and waiting for the closest lift to slide open. It disgorges a handful of people, and she immediately ducks forward, pulling Bail in and then triggering the door before anyone else waiting can join them. there's a shudder, a flicker of lights that’s entirely unnerving, and then the lift slowly starts to rise.</p><p>“Dad,” Leia says, and she looks up at him. She’s pale, unsettled, but her mouth is a firm line, her shoulders squared. “The Guard stormtroopers—”</p><p>“Clone troopers,” Bail says, quiet, and leans back against the wall of the lift, trying to work it out. “Commander Fox was the head of the Coruscant Guard during the Clone Wars. And…I believe he was killed two years after you were born.”</p><p>Leia's eyes widen, and she looks away. The lift doesn’t have windows, just plain metal walls that throw back distorted reflections, and Bail can see her close her eyes for a long moment, fingers twisting in the edges of her sleeves, before she says very softly, “The Death Star fired on Alderaan.”</p><p>“Yes,” Bail agrees, and his mouth still tastes like ashes. He wonders if the light-spots in the edges of his vision will ever fully go away. “I felt it hit, and then all I felt was you.”</p><p>Leia knows what he means, because it’s always been there, but never mentioned. Safer, under the Empire, to simply have Ferus follow close behind her and contain what he could, and then, after Ferus's murder—</p><p>Well. The Rebellion took most of Leia's energy and effort, and left far less time for outbursts like those that once would have gotten her caught.</p><p>Pale, Leia takes a breath, curls her hands in front of her. “The Empire will have noticed—” she starts, and then stops short, the words registering. <em>Bail’s</em> words registering, and—Bail doesn’t blame her for the pause. She’s never known anything except the Empire, and to realize that, potentially, they're in a moment when that Empire doesn’t even exist, when moments of Force use won't be sought out and the users hunted down by Inquisitors, is…almost bewildering.</p><p>The Empire won't have noticed her Force use, because the Empire as they knew it doesn’t exist. Not if Padmé is still alive.</p><p>“Was it me?” Leia asks, and the words are all sharp around the edges, a demand. “Did I…”</p><p>Bail closes his eyes, thinks of Padmé with bruises all around her throat. They covered them for her funeral, but Bail saw them. He’ll never forget them.</p><p>“Your biological father was very strong in the Force,” he says, feels Leia's laser-focused attention. “And you are…untrained. I don’t know how such things would come together, but—clearly they did.”</p><p>Leia looks away again, raising her hands to her hood, tugging the white cloth back a little more. “I felt something else, too,” she says, and it’s surprisingly soft after her sharpness. Her eyes are distant, and she rubs at her chest like it aches. “Someone else. I was screaming, and so was he.”</p><p>Twin stars, Bail thinks, and breathes out slowly. The boy Obi-Wan took, doubtless. The boy and Leia were in distress, full of grief, and they both reacted, and between them—</p><p>Well. Something happened, certainly. Right now Bail just needs to find out how <em>much</em> happened.</p><p>“Regardless,” he says, and tries to make it light even though his throat aches. “We ended up in a time when the commander is still alive. I hope he won't remember to follow up, but we should likely find somewhere out of the way to spend a few days, just in case.”</p><p>Leia opens her mouth, pauses, then scowls. “The safehouses,” she says, and Bail inclines his head. If the Rebellion hasn’t been formed, they won't exist yet. Or—not in <em>quite</em> the same form. House Antilles has a few properties on Coruscant that Bail hasn’t accessed since well before his marriage, but they should still be there, and he knows how to get in.</p><p>“We’ll make our way to Coco Town,” he says quietly, because that’s one of the safer spots even if he’s wrong and the Empire is still looming. It’s halfway between the Senate and the less-used entrances to the undercity, and Bail can't navigate the latter as well as the former, but he can get them out of sight at the very least.</p><p>Padmé was there, though. That must mean the Empire hasn’t risen yet, because the Empire’s creation killed Padmé just as much as her husband did.</p><p>“Dad,” Leia says, and one of her hands finds Bail’s wrist. “The man you described, who was he?”</p><p>Bail smiles wryly, pulling her into his side and wrapping his arms around her. The image of Vader, huge and monstrous and looming, holding Leia pinned against him as she screamed, is going to live within his nightmares for the rest of his life. The thought of how Vader came to have captured her will, too. She’d left from above Scarif as the battle raged, and Vader must have taken her ship, must have <em>known</em>. Must have used Alderaan to try to wring information from her, and Bail <em>knows</em> his daughter, knows she would never give up any piece of the Rebellion.</p><p>The pride he has in her doesn’t change the anger he feels, though, just as sharp and helpless as it was the day the Empire rose. He remembers standing with Palpatine and a handful of other senators, watching the ranks of clones, all changed, all <em>robotic</em>, standing at attention. That same helplessness is knotted up in his throat, making it hard to breathe, and he presses his brow to the top of Leia's head, feels her arms come up around him again in a desperate grip.</p><p>“Vader,” he says, and her whole body stiffens, fury and fear just barely contained. “As he once was, as a Jedi, before the Emperor convinced him to join the cause of the Empire.”</p><p>There's a moment of silence, and then Leia says, vicious, “If we kill him now he can never join the Empire.”</p><p>Bail snorts, because he knows his own abilities, and he’s decent with a blaster, but—against a fully-trained and impossibly powerful Jedi Knight? There's little chance. Leia might have a better one, but she’s untrained, and that feels like the greatest oversight right now, but there was no other choice. The Emperor would have felt it if he’d had her trained, if he’d tried to procure a teacher. Ferus was already at greater risk than anyone, just being her guard, and he paid for it with his life.</p><p>“He’s powerful,” he says quietly. “And I don’t know what happened to bring us here.”</p><p>“I just wanted everything to <em>stop</em>,” Leia admits, and she knots her fingers in his cloak again, leans fully against him. “I hated Vader and Tarkin so much, and I wanted them <em>gone</em>, and then—I felt you, and I realized that what I really wanted was you alive.”</p><p>Bail’s breath shakes, and—he doesn’t understand it. he doesn’t understand anything. His mouth is full of ash and Fox is alive and <em>Padmé</em> is alive, and there's nothing in any of this that’s reasonable except for Leia's existence. She’s a thing that defies all reason, all logic, and she saved them both. Untrained, captured, likely tortured, and she still saved them.</p><p>“Wherever we are, we’ll be safe now,” Bail promises. Alderaan still exists, if he’s alive now. Alderaan hasn’t been destroyed, Bail’s entire world burned to ash with one pass of Tarkin’s hand. And—if they really are back before the Empire’s creation, maybe there’s something to be done. Maybe the entire Republic can still be saved, or at least maintained. Maybe, like in that last moment when Leia changed everything, this is a moment that can be something of hope, not just defeat.</p><p>“That other person,” Leia says. “The one I felt. We need to find him.”</p><p>Bail breathes, but—it’s true. He’s regretted for years now not being able to take the boy, and for all it would have been too obvious, too clear a sign of whose children precisely Bail had taken in, he’s thought about the boy more often than he would like. One little boy left to Tatooine and the forces there, to Obi-Wan’s distant observation and weathered grief, and Bail will never regret any part of taking Leia, but if he could have taken both of Padmé’s children, he would have.</p><p>“Your brother,” he says, quiet, and Leia's breath catches. “Your twin brother. We’ll find him, Leia.”</p><p>Leia doesn’t say anything for a long, long moment as the lift creaks upwards. Then, with a shaky breath, she nods, mouth firming into a stubborn line. “We will,” she says, and catches herself on the wall as the lift shudders to a stop. When the doors slide open, it’s with a whirl of truly fresh air, a wash of city-sounds that make the world come alive, and Bail lets Leia pull him out though a crowd that’s already trying to push in. They're on a high walkway, a familiar one, and Bail looks out over Coruscant, at the distant dome of the Senate Building, and realizes he can't see a single scar of war anywhere on the surface.</p><p>And then, loud in his ears, Leia makes a sound. Bail turns instantly, following her gaze in the opposite direction, and stills.</p><p>There, bright and golden against Coruscant's grey skyline, stands the Jedi Temple, gleaming in the morning sun that filters between the clouds. There are speeders around it, a tangle of life, and it’s too far for Bail to make out any details, but the statues at the entrance still stand. There are no marks of blaster-fire or explosions, no signs of the massacre that’s going to take place.</p><p>The Jedi Temple stands, and Bail can't help but grip Leia's arm, his whole chest one knotted tangle of hope and fear and joy.</p><p>“The Jedi,” he says, and it rasps in his throat. “The Jedi are still here.”</p><p>“I didn’t realize it looked like that,” Leia says, and there's an edge to it, the anger at the Empire that Bail knows so well bubbling to the surface. “It’s beautiful.”</p><p>It is, Bail thinks, and even more than Padmé being alive, even more than Coruscant unmarked by war, this feels like a <em>chance</em>. This feels like hope.</p><p>“Let’s go, Leia,” he says quietly, and there's nothing settled, nothing resolved, still a hundred thousand things he doesn’t know, but as Leia falls into step with him, as they head towards one of the public transports that will take them towards Coco Town, Bail can't help but keep looking towards the Temple.</p><p>In the falling sunlight, it glows, and the light-spots in Bail’s vision finally feel like they're fading.</p> </div> <!--/main--> </div> <!-- end of cache --> </div> </div> <!-- END work skin --> </div> <!-- END work --> <!-- BEGIN comment section --> <!-- Gets embedded anywhere we need to list comments on a top-level commentable.
