brothers.<p>a/n Story dedicated to Moppet Poppet, Cheating Death’s 500th reviewer!</p><p><b>Of Western Stars</b><br />By neutral</p><p>Chapter two - of comings and goings</p><p>Just then, Sirius wanted nothing more than to transform back into a human and run after the retreating child. But discretion caught up with him just in time; what would Harry think? Wouldn’t he be horrified to find a strange man who looked like he had been through hell and back, suddenly rush at him?</p><p>Sirius was in a daze after Harry left, eyes unfocused and unseeing. He watched the place where last stood, feeling his stomach sink and twist with desperation. The urge was too strong, to run after his godson and spill his entire story. But Harry was so innocent, so naïve. Would he accept it? Would he believe it?</p><p>Sirius cringed inwardly, remembering the image of his godson, eyes squeezed tight and hands raised defensively over him was burned into his eyelids. He had been so frightened…</p><p>Harry ran from him. Harry was afraid of him.</p><p>He had never expected, never dreamed, that his godson would fear him.</p><p>Sirius shut his eyes, trying to block the childish voice, clouded with fear and confusion. Harry had crumpled under his glare almost as if he had been anticipating pain. Most children would have wailed and protested, but Harry was disturbingly silent, almost… accepting. And with the bones that protruded from his shoulder and the cheekbones that stood out, Sirius couldn’t help but wonder about the kind of treatment he received from the Dursleys. Harry was nothing like the outgoing and energetic James that he had expected seeing, but did he really expect such a child after seeing his picture on the newspaper? With that pale and sickly frame, he just seemed to scream neglect.</p><p>Sirius growled, low in his throat. If those muggles touched one hair on his godson’s head, he would shred them all to pieces. Forget about another life sentence, it would be worth it. Bitterly, Sirius grinded his paws against the earth.</p><p><i> Harry wasn’t happy…</i></p><p> Somehow, just seeing his godson opened rather than healed wounds. Harry’s wild hair and round rimmed glasses was just too reminiscent of James. His best friend’s face seemed to accuse him of all the promises he fell short of fulfilling.</p><p><i> Look what happened to my son, </i>James seemed to say. <i>Look what happened to him when you condemned his parents to an early grave.</i></p><p>With a rueful whine, Sirius laid back down. It was his fault James and Lily died. It was his fault that Harry suffered. It was all his fault! And Harry was the one person he had a chance to redeem himself. Sirius sighed, hoping beyond hope that he would be able to find Harry again.</p><p>Just seeing Harry wasn’t enough, Sirius needed to speak to him. He had to.</p><p>Harry shuddered when he approached the park bench, nervously searching for the dog. He shot forward hurriedly, retrieved the bag of forgotten cat food, and rushed back to the sidewalk as fast as he could. He had been hopelessly embarrassed when he rushed back to Mrs. Figg without her groceries. He would never hear the end of it if she told the Dursleys. Mrs. Figg didn’t seem to mind all that much, but Harry tortured himself over it. Still, it was several hours before he even found the courage to return.</p><p>The memory of the dog still haunted him. The odd, pale blue eyes framed with long, coal black fur. Its razor sharp teeth grazing his shoulder as it sniffed at his face. But there was a nagging doubt in the back of his mind. The dog, was it really evil? It didn’t hurt him. It licked his face. It liked him!</p><p><i> But it was large. It looked like it was going to eat him…</i> Harry protested silently in his mind.</p><p>Yes, but it didn’t do anything. Harry brushed his hand against his cheek where the dog had nudged him. He couldn’t help but feel drawn to the large black dog somehow. It was as if they had met before. There was the comforting familiarity of it; Harry couldn’t help but pocket a few slices of left over pie, belatedly realizing that he had saved it for the starved dog.</p><p><i> Shouldn’t I be afraid of it?</i> Harry wondered.</p><p><i> But perhaps it was really, really hungry. Maybe it would be nicer after it ate.</i></p><p> Unconsciously, Harry scanned the deserted park for the large shaggy animal. He walked quietly to the dreaded line of shrubs, but it was dragging him like a moth to a flame. Harry pushed the branches aside.</p><p>It was empty.</p><p>Harry’s heart sank. He wasn’t sure why he felt so disappointed, its absence was just painful. Harry examined the large paw prints the dog left in its wake, trailing away. Chewing his lip in disappointment, Harry pulled the pie from his oversized pocket, wrapped in cloth. He placed it in the most obvious place he could find. Shoulders slumped in defeat, Harry picked his way back to the park, throwing one last glance at the shroud of bushes.</p><p>“He what?!” Remus stood up sharply, knocking his tattered chair to the floor.</p><p>Dumbledore sighed, closing his eyes wearily. He seemed out of place in Remus’ small living room, his flawless blue robes contrasting against the pieces of ill-used furniture. The remains of a couch were scattered near his feet and a coffee table laid on its side.</p><p>“Sirius escaped,” he repeated.</p><p>“But how? Isn’t that impossible?” Remus choked out. The recent full moon had taken its toll on him; his skin was ghastly pale and his entire frame shook with exhaustion. But this news was rapidly draining whatever energy he had left.</p><p>“Obviously it isn’t,” Dumbledore said, voice deceptively calm. His mouth was set in a grim line, and his blue eyes burned with cold fury.</p><p>“But with the dementors, he should be insane,” Remus continued desperately. But his voice betrayed how much it cost him even admitting to those words. He took several unsteady steps back when the floor seemed to sway dangerously.</p><p>“Sirius was unaffected.” Dumbledore said slowly, looking just as tired as the werewolf for the briefest of moments. “He had escaped four days ago, with this found in his cell.”</p><p>Dumbledore held out a faded newsprint picture, shredded ruthlessly in half, but Remus recognized it instantly. His eyes widened, and would have fallen on the floor if Dumbledore hadn’t caught his arm and guided him to a chair.</p><p>“Harry’s picture…,” Remus whispered hoarsely. “How did he get it?”</p><p>“Nobody is sure, but they say he’s memorized the news article. Harry’s safety is now our top concern. Fudge is still trying to scavenge his reputation; he’s trying to hush up Sirius’ escape as much as possible,” Dumbledore’s eyes flashed dangerously. “The security around him isn’t going to increase. Fudge is trying to tell everyone that it is perfectly adequate. With luck, Sirius is still another week's walk to Little Whinging. Since he is without a wand, we still have some time.”</p><p>“Sirius wants to kill Harry? His own godson… it’s still hard to believe,” Remus trailed off, sinking into the chair weakly. The mention of those years reopened barely healed scars that sent flashes of raw pain. Remus ran a tired hand over his face. He had spent so many years trying to run and hide from the past…</p><p>Dumbledore looked to his former student sympathetically for a moment. “Remus, I know this will be hard.”</p><p>Remus snapped back into focus. His face darkened, “Dumbledore, are you planning something?”</p><p>“The protection around Harry will need to be raised, and as you know, the wards may not have an affect on Sirius since he does not have a wand. We need to send someone…”</p><p>Remus was silent, his eyes fixed unblinkingly in front of him. His expression was restrained, years of discrimination had beaten that into him.</p><p>“I have already set up arrangements with Arabella. We need to place another person there, with her posing as an old lady isn’t going to be enough. We need someone who understands Sirius and someone who Harry will be able to trust,” Dumbledore said as he carefully gauged Remus for a reaction.</p><p>“You want me to go,” Remus said simply.</p><p>“Both Arabella and I think it is the best. The final decision is your own.”</p><p>Remus swallowed uneasily. Going to Harry would mean facing the pain that he tried to forget for five years, but it was James son…</p><p>Remus’ eyes narrowed in determination. “I’ll do it.”</p><p>Dumbledore smiled sadly.</p><p>But the resolve in the younger man’s grey eyes darkened into doubt. Remus chewed his lip, looking up at the headmaster uneasily. “Dumbledore, but what about my…”</p><p>“There’s really nothing we can do about that,” Dumbledore murmured with a sigh. “We’ve arranged it so that Severus will be able to prepare some Wolfsbane for you each month and you can spend each full moon by apparating back to Hogwarts. We can spare you a room.”</p><p>Uncertainty was obvious in Remus’ face, but he nodded slightly, eyes downcast.</p><p>“Arabella’s going to take you in as her nephew. You’re going to pose as a teacher,” Dumbledore explained.</p><p>Remus frowned. “Teacher? But the muggle elementary schools already ended for the summer.”</p><p>Dumbledore smiled, eyes twinkling for the first time. “Have you ever played soccer, Remus?”</p><p>*</p><p>This is another very short chapter. Urg. Sorry! Remus seems a bit weak doesn't he? But hey, lets cut him some slack. Nothing much is established in this chapter, it's a slow transition. So far, considering how much I planned out, I'm guessing this is going to be about 15 chapters. Ack! Moppet, look what you did!</p><p>SasseeSam - yeah, Sirius seems to always get the short end of the stick! But its still frightening for a seven year old to get pounced by a dog his own size.</p><p>Lady Foxfire - yes, I will! It’s just that, these chapters seems so choppy and short. Ack!</p><p>Black Sparkles - I will!</p><p>Mihoshe - thanks! I’m glad you liked it! I hope this chapter isn’t too short, but the next chapter doesn’t really tie into it well.</p><p>Ithica - I’m glad you like it! I hope I don’t disappoint you *hides*</p><p>Seeker-2000 - really? Wow! I’m flattered. Thank you!!</p><p>SiriusBPadfoot - yes! Or as soon as I can. I’m nearing AP tests and I won’t be able to spit them out as fast as before. Urg! With the recent computer virius and everything. I’m glad you liked this one! Its not nearly as exciting though… *sighs dejectedly*</p><p>Evie - really? Really? Really? Wow… it didn’t seem… choppy or anything? Weighed down? Or overused idea? *scratches head nervously*</p><p>Prongsjr - thanks!!</p><p>Linsday - I can’t say! *grins* that’s a secret, but I am a big fan of Sirius and Harry godfather godson ish type things, so…</p><p>Lisa - thanks!!</p><p>Vmr - I will!</p><p>Kugel - I will!! I really will try to complete this.</p><p>Bec - that’s great encouragement! I’m glad you liked it. I was a bit worried that Harry didn’t seem like the seven year-old and… urg… the plot was too rushed or something. *sighs*</p><p>Keara Jordan - wow! Little brothers? How many and how old? I’m the onlie, so I really have no clue how kids act.</p><p>Lassy D. - thank you!!</p><p>Nicky - that’s a secret! *grins*</p><p>Kat - I’m not saying! *cackles*</p><p>Jayde - really? Dogs are actually quite nice if you don’t run. Of course… I didn’t know that when I was younger in front of a black lab. *laughs nervously*</p><p>Catspook - I donnuo. I think it’s because writers are the most critical of their own work. I’m glad you like it though.</p><p>MercS - ouch!! That must have really hurt, the fever, the pains, urg… ok, this was from the review from Cheating Death, but still! Ouch… Tell her to get well soon from me! Yeah, especially since Padfoot’s suspicious of how Harry’s treated at home. He’s all frustrated and angry now.</p><p>Gwen - *cackle* that’ll be interesting!</p><p>Erin Finnlaith - *backs away nervously* I will, I really will!</p><p>Moppet Poppet - uhh…. Are you… alright? *takes away the cigar*</p><p>Allocin - really? Wow… you know, it’s really tempting to upload a horrible cliffy and announce that that story will be discontinued. But… I’m not that evil… yet *laughs evilly*</p><p><!-- end story --> </p></div> </div> <center> <form> <table style="margin-top:5px"><tr><td align="center"> <div class="buttons"> <button type="button" class="positive" onclick="select_drop(&quot;review&quot;);"> <img src="/static/ficons/comment.png" /> Review this Story/Chapter </button> </div> </td></tr></table></form> </center> <div style="padding-left:10px;padding-top:10px;"> <form name="myselect" id="myselect"><table width="100%" class="myborder" cellpadding="4"><tr><td> <select name="opt" title="story actions"><option value="abuse">Report Possible Abuse </option><option value="fs" selected="selected">Add Story to Favorites </option><option value="sa">Add Story to Story Alert </option><option value="fa">Add Author to Favorites </option><option value="aa">Add Author to Author Alert </option><option value="c2">Add Story to Community Archive </option></select><input type="button" value="Go" onclick="select_drop(document.myselect.opt.options[document.myselect.opt.selectedIndex].value)" /></td> <td align="RIGHT"><input type="BUTTON" value=" « " onclick="self.location='/s/662406/1/Of_Western_Stars'" /><select title="chapter navigation" name="chapter" onchange="self.location = '/s/662406/'+ this.options[this.selectedIndex].value + '/Of_Western_Stars';"><option value="1">1. of blurry pictures</option><option value="2" selected="selected">2. of comings and goings</option><option value="3">3. of cold baths and flowery soaps</option><option value="4">4. of familiar strangers</option><option value="5">5. of truth and lies</option><option value="6">6. of improvision</option><option value="7">7. of sour discoveries</option><option value="8">8. of bitter realities</option><option value="9">9. of bitter realities part 2</option><option value="10">10. of unpleasant revelations</option><option value="11">11. of a road less traveled</option><option value="12">12. of unfavorable results</option><option value="13">13. of the question of trust</option><option value="14">14. of reacquaintance</option><option value="15">15. of the past that always returns to haunt</option><option value="16">16. of spotted ceilings and broken cabs</option><option value="17">17. of lessons of faith</option><option value="18">18. of confessions and explanations</option><option value="19">19. of dreaming of birthdays</option><option value="20">20. of opening doors</option><option value="21">21. of invisible men</option><option value="22">22. of miscommunication</option><option value="23">23. of wand points</option><option value="24">24. of convergent understandings</option><option value="25">25. of reconciliation</option><option value="26">26. of reacquaintance on more levels than on...</option><option value="27">27. of uncompromising circumstances</option><option value="28">28. of broken glass</option><option value="29">29. of blood</option><option value="30">30. of light and dark</option><option value="31">31. of unexpected occurrences and overdue ex...</option><option value="32">32. of creation, invention, and new horizons</option><option value="33">33. epilogue 1: of home comings</option><option value="34">34. epilogue 2: of beginning anew</option><option value="35">35. of mini alternative universes</option></select><input type="BUTTON" value=" » " onclick="self.location='/s/662406/3/Of_Western_Stars'" /></td> </tr></table></form> <br /><center> </center> <br /></div><div align="right" style="height:10px;border-top:1px solid #cdcdcd;"><a href="#top">Return to Top</a></div></div><!-- Start Quantcast tag --><noscript> <img src="http://pixel.quantserve.com/pixel/p-ceTXUNJJEE0hQ.gif" style="display: none;" border="0" height="1" width="1" alt="Quantcast" /></noscript><!-- End Quantcast tag -->
