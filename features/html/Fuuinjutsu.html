Until things would settle down, Hiruzen had taken responsibility for the boy. His shadow clone of course was still in the office since with the recently destroyed village, his recently dead successor, and horrible teammate that would take any opportunity to gain power, he couldn’t just </span> <em> <span>leave</span> </em> <span> completely. </span> </p><p> <span>He’d taken the hat back and gotten shit back in order with ANBU commander Dragon’s assistance.</span> </p><p> <span>Now, he stared at the blonde and whiskered baby that was the new kyuubi jinchuriki and Minato’s only legacy. Tears burned the old man’s eyes even if they didn’t fall. He could almost picture the boy’s future. He knew what the clans would call for. It’s why he’d stepped down three years ago to let Minato take over. And things had been going so well. He’d finally been getting along with his son, Minato was running a tight ship, and Konoha was at peace.</span> </p><p> <span>“Oh you poor boy, the Kami’s will not be in your favor I’m afraid. As soon as the council learns who you are and what you contain, there will be no laws able to stop the hatred.” Hiruzen said pragmatically.</span> </p><p> <span>“Then Do something about it.” A low voice murmured and Hiruzen was standing bo staff in hand at the intruder. Only his ANBU should have been near him. Minato’s own guard, the only people in the know of the baby’s location. </span> </p><p> <span>But the sight before him stopped the Sandaime. “M-m-m-minato?!” Hiruzen stuttered even as the ANBU had dropped down around the baby at the Sandaime’s flared chakra, they too paused in shock.</span> </p><p> <span>Until the Man before them with golden hair, white haori with fames and Almost glowing blue eyes stepped out of the shadows completely. It was then they got a look at the two sets of three whiskers on his cheeks and obvious dark orange ANBU shirt beneath it.</span> </p><p> <span>“No.” The man said calmly. “Minato is dead. The last piece of him remains in his son for when the boy would one day need it.”</span> </p><p> <span>“Who are you?” Hiruzen demanded sharply.</span> </p><p> <span>The Man bowed shallowly. “Namikaze Arashi.”</span> </p><p> <span>The Hokage and Guard Paled. They knew that name. The name Kushina had whispered on her deathbed, her tearful words being that she’d won a bet against Minato to name their son that instead of Naruto. Named after her own father.</span> </p><p> <span>Hiruzen glanced back to the whiskered baby and to the adult man. “Impossible.”</span> </p><p> <span>“Yes.” Arashi agreed. “But i’m known to complete the impossible. So, I do not have much time. I need to complete the seal before i overtake baby arashi.”</span> </p><p> <span>“Why?” Hiruzen’s mind quickly caught up after he saw the pain being hidden in Arashi’s eyes at whatever was going on here.</span> </p><p> <span>“War, War to end all wars.” Arashi stated grimly. “The Nations banned together but it wasn’t enough. The enemy was too powerful. The bijuu weren’t protected. I was the last host, the last uzumaki. It wasn’t enough. We were too weak.”</span> </p><p> <span>Hiruzen paled. “Kami….” He whispered.</span> </p><p> <span>“I cannot be here as an adult, the paradox and ripples would create a new future i wouldn’t be able to predict. Growing up again is going to be a bitch, but it needs to be done. I need to grow up with my peers.”</span> </p><p> <span>“You’ll remember?” HIruzen gasped surprised.</span> </p><p> <span>Arashi nodded. “Hai. Now, something i want you to do jiji. Namikaze Arashi will disappear. Only Arashi will return as a clanless, orphan when it’s time for the academy, sponsored by a shinobi you trust with my life. Now…” a grin appeared on that face and suddenly the Hokage and ANBU could see it. “Uzumaki Naruto will take the fall as the Kyuubi jinchuriki. The red haired boy will take on the hatred of the village. When he fails the Genin exams for the third time for his shit chakra control, he will disappear completely. He will stay a Civilian with a single ANBU watcher. Bait if you will. All while Arashi, the Clanless orphan stays a shinobi and passes as a quiet but underestimated genius that never boasts about his skills.”</span> </p><p> <span>“How will you accomplish this?” Hiruzen asked.</span> </p><p> <span>“Kage Bushin, Solid Henge, and Seals.” Arashi commented.</span> </p><p> <span>“When?”</span> </p><p> <span>“As soon as the assimilation is complete. Place a seal on my body where it won’t be detected that henges my hair red, and hides the whiskers. Only you and Minato’s guard know what I look like. Keep it that way. Naruto will look like an actual Uzumaki. Arashi will slip under the radar. As soon as i’ve gained the chakra control necessary I’ll create a second clone to be one or the other.”</span> </p><p> <span>Hiruzen frowned. “Are you sure about this? Isn’t this taking the boy’s life away?”</span> </p><p> <span>Arashi’s gazed turned sad. “I do not wish for the innocent boy to suffer the childhood i did. At least as an adult i’ve already overcomed the village’s hatred and can ignore it a second time. Why make the child suffer? Plus, we are the same. Our souls the same. Mine is just a quarter century older.”</span> </p><p> <span>The Sandaime stepped back and waved to the ANBU to do the same. They did as ordered and watched a grown up Arashi walk to the sleeping baby in the bassinet. Arashi huffed as he looked at his baby self.</span> </p><p> <span>“Still weird.” he muttered but his chakra built before a seal appeared on the floor surrounding them both. Chakra rose before Arashi placed a hand on the baby’s chest. Closing his eyes, Arashi willed the second half of the seal he’d used to get here, into place.</span> </p><p> <em> <span>Soul takeover.</span> </em> <span> He whispered in his mind. A flash of chakra later and both the Adult Arashi and the seals were gone.</span> </p><p> <span>Hiruzen rushed to the baby and watched as the seals on the boy’s chest sunk in mostly while the Kyuubi seal squirmed and swirled, but settled into a similar but slightly different shape. Yet, still locked just as tightly.</span> </p><p> <span>The Hokage looked at the baby’s face when he suddenly yawned widely and big blue eyes opened. Sarutobi met those eyes and saw that the pain he’d seen in their pair was gone, and determination replaced it. Then the baby smiled and cooed, tiny arms reaching for Hiruzen who melted.</span> </p><p> <span>“Oh you are already a troublemaker.” He whispered. “Giving this old man a heartattack like that.” He lifted the babe up and held him close. Baby Arashi snuffling until he was settled deeper into hiruzen’s haori. A deep breath from the babe and Arashi was once more fast asleep.</span> </p><p> <span>“Obviously, I do not need to speak of how this will never be spoken of again?” Hiruzen looked to his three guards.</span> </p><p> <span>Genma removed his mask. “How were you so sure it was Arashi?”</span> </p><p> <span>“He had his mother’s eyes and father’s will.” Hiruzen said moving to sit with the sleeping babe that didn’t seem like he’d be letting go anytime soon.</span> </p><p> <span>“Hokage-sama?” Raido asked confused.</span> </p><p> <span>“Kushina never went on infiltration Missions because she couldn’t lie worth a damn. I chose Minato as my successor because his will of fire was the strongest i’d ever seen before. Now...Now those two traits have been surpassed by their very own son. Arashi held himself like a Kage. Spoke like a Kage, and risked everything to protect everyone. And i felt his chakra. He had traces of the kyuubi within him even as it faded, probably already merged with this time’s Kyuubi. He was holding back by sheer will to get his last orders across from one Leader to another.”</span> </p><p> <span>“Understood Sir.” The two said softly and returned to post with their third.</span> </p><p> <span>Humming to himself the hokage thought of the seals that he could use to change Arashi’s appearance. Molding his Chakra the Hokage placed a finger behind the boy’s ear and let the seal form there. Hidden behind the ear, and covered by the spikes of his hair. Activating the seal, Whiskers disappeared, and blonde hair turned Uzumaki red.</span> </p><p> <span>~</span> </p><p> <span>Months later, it was as Hiruzen had once feared, Naruto was no longer allowed to be under the Sarutobi clan’s care. He was to be put up in the orphanage.</span> </p><p> <span>“I want you three on his detail.” Hiruzen ordered behind privacy seals the same day the decision was made.</span> </p><p> <span>“What about you Hokage-sama? What about Kakashi?” Owl asked.</span> </p><p> <span>“I’ll have dragon get me a new guard, people he trusts. Kakashi...can join Naruto’s guard if he wishes. No doubt he believes that he’s Kushina’s child. Thankfully that will keep most suspicions of his paternal heritage underwraps. Go, and make sure that no harm comes to him.”</span> </p><p> <span>“Hai!” The trio of anbu disappeared.</span> </p><p> <span>~</span> </p><p> </p><p> <span>Naruto stared at his reflection once more. Three years had passed since he’d taken over his past self’s body and soul. Sure, he was able to mentally step back during the baby years and let his body grow naturally. Only really take over mentally when he’d learned to crawl and then walk. He didn’t remember his infant years of his first life. And he’d do his best to suppress these years once more. He did not need the memory of Jiji changing his diapers, thank you very much.</span> </p><p> <span>The blue eyed boy was still very much hated and ignored. The one attempt the Matron tried to harm him, Owl, ferret, and hawk swooped in and took her away. The new matron wasn’t much better but knew better than to physically abuse him.</span> </p><p> <span>He ignored her and just continued to practice walking and running, climbing the steps and any surface he could reach. It drove the other workers absolutely nutty that he was practically a monkey and would climb up to the highest shelfs just to startle them. Their shrieks were painful, yet music to his prankster ears. Well….he had to start somewhere didn’t he?</span> </p><p> <span>Being an adult in a toddler’s body also meant, he was better at sneaking down to the kitchens, when he hadn’t been fed, to get food. One of his ANBU helping him when he just looked at them if he really did need the help. Mostly it was during times he wasn’t quite quick enough to escape before getting caught. Sue him, he was a child.</span> </p><p> <span>Now at three, he...he really wanted to help Neji. But he didn’t know how the ripples would affect him.</span> </p><p> <span>Hiruzen hadn’t come to see him, as he’d told Naruto he wouldn’t until the boy was closer to academy age. Any sooner and it would be suspicious. It made sense to Arashi then why hiruzen didn’t approach him until he was six the first time.</span> </p><p> <span>But the boy needed to be taken to Hiruzen.</span> </p><p> <span>Thankfully his prankster reputation within the orphanage would aid him with what he had planned.</span> </p><p> <span>A very foxy grin lifted his lips as the child pulled out the backpack as large as himself and tossed it over his back. Slipping out the back door, Naruto, soon to be known as Konoha’s Number one prankster would begin his reign of chaos.</span> </p><p> </p><p> <span>Owl, Ferret, and Hawk wondered what their time-travelling chibi hokage was up to. They’d seen him stocking piling random things over the past weeks, but didn’t understand what the boy’s plans were. Especially since they were all unsure if he actually remembered his first life or not. They remembered how nutty Kushina was and just assumed it was normal Uzumaki behavior. Not a master infiltration specialist at work.</span> </p><p> <span>Trailing their target, they watched as the boy….oh...oh dear….. The three ANBU thought semi stunned.</span> </p><p> <span>“Well….they did try to hurt him a two months ago during the orphanage outting to the park.” Hawk reasoned.</span> </p><p> <span>“And he is known for sneaking out and wandering the woods near training grounds if he wasn’t kicked out anyways.” Ferret agreed.</span> </p><p> <span>“It’s not our fault if he picked up trapping and just thought i was neat pranks.” Owl finished their cover story they would speak if barriers weren’t up in the Hokage’s office. Especially since all of it was true. It just finally clicked in his head the odd habits the boy had taken to as soon as he’d learned to run. Being outdoors was the only freedom Naruto had from the hatred of the orphanage.</span> </p><p> <span>Once the boy was done setting up his trap in one of the local markets near the orphanage, the trio of ANBU dropped down around the fleeing child. The redhead paused for half a step before snorting.</span> </p><p> <span>“You’ll have to try better than that if you want to hide from a natural sensor.” The Uzumaki huffed.</span> </p><p> <span>“It’s late.” Owl chuckled and scooped the cheeky brat up. Naruto just blinked before surprising Genma by settling into his hold.</span> </p><p> <span>The trio leapt onto the roofs and Naruto let out a sigh. “I want to be big again.” The child murmured.</span> </p><p> <span>“Soon.” ferret called gently.</span> </p><p> <span>Naruto grumbled wordlessly, but settled into Genma’s hold. Only setting off alarms in Genma’s head at the realization that….even as an adult...was Arashi touch-starved? </span> </p><p> <span>He would think on it later, but for now their charge needed to get back his energy from climbing and parkouring across an entire street.</span> </p><p> </p><p> <span>The following morning, Flour canons exploded across the south market street, along with snare traps and balloons of water and feathers. Furious the stall owners called in a complaint with the police and evidence was found leading with the Inuzuka’s help to the orphanage to one redheaded child of only three.</span> </p><p> <span>Manhandled by the Uchiha officer, Naruto was taken directly to the Hokage’s office due to the size of his prank.</span> </p><p> </p><p> <span>Innocent blue eyes puppy eyed up at the hokage even as the stern Uchiha still blocked him from the door.</span> </p><p> <span>Hiruzen raised a brow at the child barely out of his toddler years. He and Naruto’s guards had discussed it over the past three years on if the child actually still had his older memories. At first it hadn’t seemed like it. Just a normal baby….well, as normal as any Uzumaki baby could be from Hiruzen’s own memory.</span> </p><p> <span>“Are you telling me a Three year old pranked the south Market? Alone?”</span> </p><p> <span>“His were the only scents until his guards must have found him and escorted him back to the Orphanage, sir.” The Officer reported.</span> </p><p> <span>Hiruzen waved. “Thank you. You’re dismissed for now. Let me see what the boy has to say.”</span> </p><p> <span>The uchiha hesitated only a split second before leaving the rumored kyuubi brat to the Hokage. Orphans did fall under the Hokage’s jurisdiction until they were either enrolled into the shinobi or civilian academy. Then the jurisdiction was changed slightly.</span> </p><p> <span>“Hai.”</span> </p><p> <span>Once the door was shut Hiruzen got up and moved to the couch patting the seat beside him with a soft smile. “Come here child. Let’s hear your story.”</span> </p><p> <span>Biting his lip, Naruto moved to the JIji’s couch and climbed up on his own. He was still tired from the work out the night before, but still had his speedy recovery to boot.</span> </p><p> <span>“So, Care to explain little one why one of my streets are covered in flour?”</span> </p><p> <span>“They threw things at me.” He mumbled. “The Animal masks stopped them. But they were mean and shouted mean things at me.”</span> </p><p> <span>“Hmmm?” Hiruzen raised a brow while internally he fumed. “Well, I guess they did get their just desserts, but where did you learn such things?”</span> </p><p> <span>The redhead shrugged. “The shinobi in the woods. I saw him setting up a prank. Or that’s what he told me it was when i asked. But he shooed me away after. So i practiced real hard on how to set my own prank for the mean people.”</span> </p><p> <span>Hiruzen raised a brow but bit his tongue to keep from laughing. “Alright. Well, i cannot stop you from pranking young Uzumaki, but i do suggest you make sure there is no permanent damage done to people or property. There were many complaints of merchant’s products being ruined from the flour.”</span> </p><p> <span>Naruto looked down and played with his fingers. “I’m sorry mister Jiji-san.”</span> </p><p> <span>“No worries my boy.” Hiruzen chuckled and ruffled spikey red locks and didn’t pause when he felt morse code being sent to him in the boy’s underdeveloped chakra, via his head.</span> </p><p> <em> <span>December. Hyuuga. Kidnap. Kumo. Betrayal. Fake treaty. Loophole. Death.</span> </em> </p><p> <span>Hiruzen didn’t react further than letting chakra trickle back. </span> <em> <span>Affirmative.</span> </em> <span> </span> </p><p> <span>“So my boy, if you are so interested in pranking, how do you feel about becoming a shinobi in a few years? There you’d be able to turn your pranks into traps for enemies. Some small and some so big that it could take down armies.” Hiruzen smiled, keeping up the act of Grandfather and young child talking.</span> </p><p> <span>Blue eyes snapped to him and they shimmered with excitement. “Really!?”</span> </p><p> <span>“Hai~” Hiruzen chuckled humored. “Now, have you begun your writing lessons at the orphanage?”</span> </p><p> <span>Blue eyes dimmed and looked away. “The matrons won’t teach me. Says...Says demons don’t need to know how to read. Jiji-san am I really a demon?”</span> </p><p> <span>“No!” Hiruzen said firmly, his anger getting the best of him at the tears in young blue eyes. “Goodness no boy.” He took a deep breath and sighed. “You are a hero Uzumaki-san. Please ignore those that can’t see that. I promise to tell you when you make genin why they act as such, but no sooner. Can you promise me to work hard, train, and study to become a proud Genin?”</span> </p><p> <span>Blue eyes just stared at him. “So i can be really good at traps?”</span> </p><p> <span>“There is that, but do you know what it means being a shinobi?”</span> </p><p> <span>Naruto shook his head and Hiruzen let his eyes go wistful as he explained the history of Konoha, why it was built, and why it was still so strong today. How even he as the Hokage Protects all, not because it was a duty, but because the village and the people within were precious to him.</span> </p><p> <span>“There are still days where a shinobi faces the darker aspects of shinobi life, but we push through it because of our precious people.”</span> </p><p> <span>“But...But i don’t have precious people.” The child’s lip trembled. “No one likes me.”</span> </p><p> <span>“Oh? Not even your guards? I remember specifically of their fondness as they’ve watched you grow. They get particularly defensive of you if anyone talks bad about you.”</span> </p><p> <span>The Uzumaki bit his lip and looked down.</span> </p><p> <span>“Not to mention me? I know we’ve just met, but i can already feel that you are like a grandson to me. Especially since i do not have one yet.”</span> </p><p> <span>Blue eyes snapped back to him with hope. “You’ll….you’ll be my precious person?”</span> </p><p> <span>“Hai. Just as you are already precious to me Naruto-kun.” Hiruzen smiled gently.</span> </p><p> <span>“Jiji!” The boy launched at him and hiruzen took the hug. If he felt actual tears on his shoulder, he let the boy express emotions that most likely weren’t an act.</span> </p><p> <span>~</span> </p><p> <span>Hiruzen stared at the kumo representatives two months later. The Hyuuga were celebrating their heir’s birthday while Hiruzen spoke with the Ambassador that was trying to slip a loophole into the treaty.</span> </p><p> <span>“No.” Hiruzen said firmly. “Section 14 subsection 3, I will not allow this to occur. A life for a life? This is ridiculous and lacking any further context that could be abused by either party. I will not accept this treaty until this is amended. Immediately.”</span> </p><p> <span>“H-hai, Hokage-sama.” The representative said with a tight smile.</span> </p><p> <span>It took an additional two days of negotiating, but soon the treaty was complete. Hiruzen had warned Hiashi that he didn’t trust Kumo’s bloodline thieving past. Fugaku had also been given the same warning to be fair. So they accepted the increased ANBU patrols around their respective clan compounds.</span> </p><p> <span>The night before the Kumo representatives were to leave, they attempted to kidnap the hyuuga heir. ANBU caught them before they even reached Konoha’s walls, Hiashi hot on their tails with his brother.</span> </p><p> <span>Hiruzen smirked around his pipe as he wrote to the Raikage about how Konoha was within their right to hold the jounins prisoner until compensation had been paid to the hyuuga clan for traumatizing their young heir. The Raikage was furious at the men he’d given no such orders to do, but basically paid their bail. Something Hiruzen had worked into the treaty instead of death. As long as their people were kept alive, a fine would be charged for anyone that saught or caused harm to a citizen of their respective nation. Instead of death.</span> </p><p> <span>So a tense but temporary treaty was made through cooperation of merchants and safer routes.</span> </p><p> <span>~</span> </p><p> <span>Five year old Naruto stared up at the slammed door. His pack on his back and not a tear on his cheek. He just blew a raspberry at the Orphanage and took off at a light jog. Now this? Arashi remembered and never really forgot. Living on the streets. The first life it had taken almost six months for Jiji to notice.</span> </p><p> <span>This life he felt Hawk rushing off to inform the Hokage. Naruto instead found an abandoned building in the Akasan to empty his pack and start drawing out his next prank. He’d taken Jiji’s words to heart and had continued to improve his pranking skills. Asking his guards to borrow books for him. He knew Jiji would make an excuse that his guards had been assigned to teach him to read and write. So now two years later, he was steadily growing in skill. While he desired to be back at his adult strength, it...felt good to try to compare how much of a head start he had this time.</span> </p><p> <span>He’d have to get his friends started soon after he met them. They couldn’t be the kickass shinobi he remembered them yet, but maybe a push in the right direction a bit early on might save some trouble in the future? He’d already seen Neji walking around with his dad, still able to smile and very protective of Hinata.</span> </p><p> <span>Now...He just had to get the Uchiha in a good light to the people of Konoha. Maybe tear at their pride and let people see them as other human beings? Make them bring in other clans to help chase down Naruto? </span> </p><p> <span>The Redhead cackled in his hideout as he plotted out his plan. </span> </p><p> <span>~</span> </p><p> <span>Two hours later he had to put things on pause as Jiji found him and when he offered to find naruto a home, he was slightly manipulated to move the boy into a shinobi district instead of the civilian district the Elders had wanted to place him in. Hiruzen had just puffed his pipe pleased when everything came together at the end.</span> </p><p> <span>“Where else is the jinchuriki safest then hidden around other shinobi? Plus he’ll be one, one day anyways. Placing him with the civilians will only risk him turning against the village because of their misplaced anger.” Hiruzen shot back at his ex-teammates.</span> </p><p> <span>~</span> </p><p> <span>Over the following weeks the Konoha Police Force was hit with subtle pranks. Salt replaced sugar. Decaf replaced Regular coffee. Everything moved by an inch. Airhorns taped under office chairs. And many more petty pranks. What drove them up the wall is no one was coming out to confess. Until the pranks got larger as the weeks turned to months. They were being pranked within the village. Each officer was hit at least once. Enough that they were getting twitchy and paranoid about it. </span> </p><p> <span>(Stares of suspicion turned to curiosity and pity and entertainment as the crowds waited to see what Konoha’s prankster had next in store.)</span> </p><p> <span>The pranks were isolated to just the Uchiha for six months straight, getting more and more complex to where they couldn’t dodge them all. Many just giving up and taking it. Finally, finally the prankster branched out and hit the next most prideful clan. The Hyuuga were not amused when all their clothes were died an obnoxious orange. Two ex-teammates of Uchiha and Hyuuga ran into each other in the market. The uchiha stopped and stared before snorting and then bursting out laughing at his once genin teammate.</span> </p><p> <span>The resulting one sided argument as the Uchiha just couldn’t stop laughing spread rumors that the Uchiha clan did have a sense of humor even if they only felt better because they weren’t the only ones getting pranked now.</span> </p><p> <span>A month later, a different clan was hit each week. Never in an order than Shinobi could predict.</span> </p><p> <span>But the most memorable was when the Daimyo’s Cat woke up in the Inuzuka compound and caused a legendary chase across konoha. Inuzuka, Genin, and even chuunin from each clan trying to help save the damned cat before it was eaten.</span> </p><p> <span>It was when the prankster was attempting to actually prank the Uchiha within their own clan after giving them a chance to grow relaxed, that more things changed.</span> </p><p> <span>“Hey Brat!” An Uchiha Shinobi pointed at the redhead setting up a trap over the Compound guard house. Having purposely gotten caught. “What do you think you’re doing?!”</span> </p><p> <span>Naruto just grinned and blew a raspberry. “Pulling the stick out of your asses! What else?”</span> </p><p> <span>“Why you!” The two shouted having gathered a few more attention. Naruto just grinned and threw two water balloons at them. They dodged, but didn’t expect the chemical reaction when the balloons exploded. Smoke pellets exploded and with it, the paint powder. Dying the two guards and surrounding crowd caught in the explosion of smoke bright orange, pink, and green.</span> </p><p> <span>“Catch me if you can!” He taunted and took off.</span> </p><p> <span>Shouting, Naruto took the chase through Konoha exclaiming that no one would ever catch the great Uzumaki Naruto! Not even the noble Uchiha Clan.</span> </p><p> <span>And so his plan continued until he was trapped and caught by said Uchiha. Naruto pouted the entire way to the Hokage’s office. Calling for a rematch.</span> </p><p> <span>They ignored him and left him to the Hokage.</span> </p><p> <span>But Naruto didn’t stop. Whenever he played a prank over the next years, he </span> <em> <span>only</span> </em> <span> let the </span> <em> <span>Uchiha</span> </em> <span> Police catch him Or an Uchiha Shinobi. Rumor began going around that only the Uchiha were skilled enough to catch the Kyuubi brat. Especially since even the ANBU had lost the boy multiple times. The exception being when he’d pissed off a Kunoichi ANBU on accident once.</span> </p><p> <span>His resulting scream of fear had been heard all across Konoha as he artfully sensed for Uchiha Fugaku’s Chakra and found it with his family’s on a walk to lunch between his shifts.</span> </p><p> <span>“Police Boss-San!” He yowled and dived onto Fugaku’s back, making the man stumble in the middle of the market and making his wife and two son’s eyes widen. “HELP She’s gonna Kill me!”</span> </p><p> <span>“You little brat!” Cat landed in the round. “How DaRe you enter the Women’s showers!”</span> </p><p> <span>“ACCIDENT!” Naruto howled hugging Fugaku’s head tighter as he sat on the man’s shoulders since he was taller than the angry kunoichi. “The Kanji was worn! I didn’t notice it was Female, not Male! I’m sorry!”</span> </p><p> <span>Cat just hissed annoyed.</span> </p><p> <span>Fugaku Cleared his throat, pushing down his annoyance and embarrassment of being used like a climbing tree. “I’ve warned you Naruto-kun to not anger Kunoichi.”</span> </p><p> <span>Blue eyes watered. “But...But it was an accident! I was just trying to get Owl back. He stole my last cup of Ramen. I had worked really hard too, to follow him without his notice so i could get him back. I thought-I thought it was the boys showers! I was gonna turn him orange...and maybe soaked in miso.”</span> </p><p> <span>Fugaku couldn’t help his chuckles and helped the boy down. “Naruto, one of these days your pranks are going to get you into trouble i nor the Hokage can get you out of.”</span> </p><p> <span>“but...But i apologized to her. I didn’t mean it for her.”</span> </p><p> <span>“Cat-san?” Fugaku looked to the ANBU Kunoichi.</span> </p><p> <span>Cat felt her resolve and anger flee at the puppy eyes Naruto shot her. “Stay out of the woman’s showers brat.”</span> </p><p> <span>Naruto scrunched up his nose. “I’m not a pervert.”</span> </p><p> <span>“Hm.” She disappeared in a shunshin.</span> </p><p> <span>Fugaku sighed as he crossed his arms and looked at Naruto. “Naruto-san.” The boy flinched and looked up at him. “Why are you still pulling these silly pranks? Didn’t the Hokage say you need to be studying for the Academy in a week?”</span> </p><p> <span>The boy looked down and stuffed his toes. “I am. I promise. But...But i have so much energy and sitting still so long is so hard~” He whined. “Plus some of the words turn backwards and it makes reading hard. Owl-san helps me when he can, but he’s not always there. He’s a shinobi of Jiji’s.”</span> </p><p> <span>Fugaku hummed and glanced over to his family. “I will...talk to your Jiji- The hokage and see if there is anything that can be done. No promises.”</span> </p><p> <span>Blue eyes beamed up at him. “Thank’s Police Boss-san! You’re the Best!” He cheered and dashed off with a wave. “Ja ne!” turning down an ally the whirlwind was gone.</span> </p><p> <span>“Anata?” Mikoto whispered with a trembling voice.</span> </p><p> <span>“Father, who was that?” Sasuke asked. Itachi still looked a little flummoxed. </span> </p><p> <span>“Uzumaki Naruto. Ward of the Hokage. He’ll be in your Academy Class next week.” Fugaku seemed to make a decision. “You’d be wise to make friends with him sasuke. He has the beginnings of a stealth and Trap master in the making.”</span> </p><p> <span>“Plus it is never wise to get on the bad side of an Uzumaki. They can be quite vindictive and stubborn if i recall the last Uzumaki. Ne, Anata?” Mikoto hummed with a smirk playing on her lips.</span> </p><p> <span>Itachi and Sasuke had the memorable shock to watch their father pale.</span> </p><p> <span>“Good Kami, must you remind me of that she-devil? I still can’t get the memories out of my head because she made sure my Sharingan had been active.”</span> </p><p> <span>Mikoto just giggled and pulled her sons forward. “Come boys, let’s go some place different for lunch. I’m feeling nostalgic.”</span> </p><p> <span>~</span> </p><p> <span>Almost Eight year old Naruto sat at his table with a shadow clone of the Hokage before him. His three ANBU guards were unmasked and had already aided in laying down the privacy barriers and silencing seals.</span> </p><p> <span>“You wanted to speak with me?” Hiruzen questioned the boy. </span> </p><p> <span>“Two things.” Naruto said and pointed to himself. “It’s about time Arashi came to Konoha. Thus, I would ask to bring one more person into the know.”</span> </p><p> <span>“Jiraiya.” Hiruzen guessed.</span> </p><p> <span>Naruto blinked at him curiously “Yes...How’d ya know?”</span> </p><p> <span>“His last message was that he’d be unreachable for a bit. His toads have been acting up recently and he went to confront them.”</span> </p><p> <span>Naruto stared before those sharp blue eyes narrowed. “I shared the Toad summoning contract with him….I didn’t think it would be possible, but...Gamamaru may know of my history out of them all.”</span> </p><p> <span>Hiruzen nodded. “We’ll wait for Jiraiya to get back for Arashi to make an entrance. What is the second thing?”</span> </p><p> <span>“I’ve been working for two years to bring the Uchiha back into the light. To stop any anger, suspicion or resentment from building any further. I believe most has been resolved from the majority of the village. Probably only Danzo’s own plants are the ones still spreading rumors. That with the Elders of the Uchiha being major sticklers for power won’t help the cause.”</span> </p><p> <span>Hiruzen’s gaze hardened. “Something will happen.”</span> </p><p> <span>“Yes.” And Naruto described everything that Itachi had once told him once he’d been reanimated a second time. Him and Shisui had both been called to help the Allied Shinobi Forces.</span> </p><p> <span>Hiruzen’s frown deepened the longer Naruto spoke about the events.</span> </p><p> <span>“Danzo’s root Cannot continue Jiji. He is destroying konoha. He is causing more harm than good.” Naruto shook his head and told about how Danzo’s actions with Hanzo caused Konoha’s second greatest enemy. How if he’d kept his nose out of it, Pein wouldn’t have been created.</span> </p><p> <span>“It’s time to start cleaning up your mistakes Jiji. Prune Konoha of it’s Rotten roots so that the great tree can be healed.”</span> </p><p> <span>Hiruzen sighed an aged and tired sound. “Hai.” He agreed. And soon the five shinobi were plotting. Genma, Raidou, and Iwashi saying they’d need additional help when it came time to attack the bases let alone find them. So they went through lists of shinobi names of the elites, and even which clans would work best in a battle. Then there was cornering Danzo.</span> </p><p> <span>It took weeks of planning, of moving things into place. Months of spreading the word to trusted people who ended up being more than happy to tear the traitor down. The Uchiha were more than happy to lend officers to gut the man that had been trying to isolate them if not for the prankster.</span> </p><p> <span>~</span> </p><p> <span>Just after the new year of Naruto’s eighth birthday, ROOT was either Killed, Captured, or rescued. Danzo was caught, disabled and chakra sealed away for trial.</span> </p><p> <span>Two weeks later, he was sentenced to death after the ANBU and Police Investigative force found evidence together that he’d been behind clan theft, funded Orochimaru’s experiments, sent the Senju clan off to die, and had plans to corner and steal the dojutsu of the Uchiha with the Hyuuga next in sight. </span> </p><p> <span>It was six months after Danzo’s death that the Uchiha were attacked by a Masked man without any warning. The Attacker only snarled in rage as he went for the civilians elderly and children first.</span> </p><p> <span>With the alarm sent up by a patrolling ANBU and Police pair (a recent partnership founded by Fugaku himself after seeing how well the two forces could work together) the masked attacker was chased off by the Hokage himself and the injured tended to. Many had lost lives in defending their families. But it was Fugaku with a bleeding but wrapped arm that grimly walked to the Hokage in clear view of his Clan and nearby shinobi that had come to help.</span> </p><p> <span>“Hokage-sama.” He called firmly, the tone of his voice silencing the surrounding shinobi aiding the Uchihas. “I’d like to report that there is a Rouge Uchiha running outside of the Clan’s and Konoha’s Knowledge.”</span> </p><p> <span>“What?” Hiruzen asked firmly. Fugaku just held his head up knowing he might be damning the rest of his clan, but he had a duty to not only them, but the man that had saved his family. Fuck the Elders, he would not risk his family’s life again.</span> </p><p> <span>“He had a mangekyou Sir. A pattern i don’t recognize, but a technique i do from our scrolls. Kamui. That’s...That’s why we weren’t able to touch him. He also felt like an Uchiha...even if it was distorted by something.”</span> </p><p> <span>Hiruzen sighed grimly. “This is not good news.”</span> </p><p> <span>“I...I suspect the Rouge Uchiha is also the one...The one that summoned the kyuubi. The one that killed my best friend, Minato.”</span> </p><p> <span>The Hokage saw the fear Fugaku held at revealing his suspicions aloud for all around them to hear.</span> </p><p> <span>“I wasn’t there for Minato’s fight with his attacker, but I do remember the words Minato had warned me of. How the attacker was after the bijuu and held a sharingan. He made me swear that you and your clan were innocent.” Hiruzen nodded. “I believed him Fugaku because Minato was a damned fine sensor and would have recognized the attacker if he knew them. Thank you for letting me know of your suspicions. You have my word that this will not reflect badly on your clan. Especially not after the Rouge Kin Slayer attacked unwarranted.”</span> </p><p> <span>“Thank you Hokage-sama.” Fugaku breathed a sigh of relief.</span> </p><p> <span>Hiruzen had a stray thought and felt a small smirk lift his lips. “Yes, Well, i have been a bit busy lately with duties as the Hokage piling up after the Elder Councils’ betrayals. I would like to offer the first seat as my new council to you Fugaku. It takes a wise man to admit what you have. To risk everything precious to you for the safety of everyone in the village.”</span> </p><p> <span>Fugaku’s jaw dropped. Hiruzen let his grandfatherly smile rise. “I expect you in my office to file the paperwork as soon as you have your Clan affairs in order. I’m sure Mikoto would do Fine as interim Clan Head until Itachi is of age. Don’t you think so?”</span> </p><p> <span>Fugaku could only nod before clearing his throat. “You honor me Hokage-sama.”</span> </p><p> <span>“No, Fugaku-dono, it is I who is Honored to have one of Konoha’s founding clans proving once more that they are part of the heart of Konoha. Now, I’ll leave you be as I too need to get things organized on my end.”</span> </p><p> <span>“Thank you Hokage-sama.” Fugaku bowed before the Hokage left with his guards.</span> </p><p> <span>Fugaku straightened up and turned to Mikoto. “Did that really happen?” he whispered.</span> </p><p> <span>Mikoto just kissed his cheek. “Yes dear. Come on, Shisui is mother henning Itachi again. We better save our boy before he strangles his cousin.”</span> </p><p> <span>“Yes dear.” The Uchiha Clan Head sighed and went to work.</span> </p><p> <span>~</span> </p><p> <span>Jiraiya stared down at the blonde boy before him. He still couldn’t believe what he’d learned in the Sacred pool. He couldn’t believe the memories that were merging with his own head.</span> </p><p> <span>“You’re taller.”</span> </p><p> <span>A tick formed above his brow. “I ate right.” he grunted back as they sat across from each other on the bed of the inn. It had been a month since the Uchiha Accident and Jiraiya had finally gotten back to hiruzen with only two words.</span> </p><p> <em> <span>I know.</span> </em> </p><p> <span>Thus, a Naruto Clone had been left in Konoha while Arashi himself had been hiraishined by his guards to the Kunai on Jiraiya. They’d then promptly left.</span> </p><p> <span>Arashi and Jiraiya were supposed to be working out a story, but Arashi was holding back his tears and Jiraiya was still in shock from learning of his death and the future arashi had just told him about. The only person he’d told everything to. Even Jiji didn’t know something unless ‘Naruto’ told him.</span> </p><p> <span>Arashi couldn’t stand it anymore and launched at his Godfather. Trembling he held the older man in a constricting hug and swore he’d not let this man die again. Jiraiya returned the hug, knowing that it must have broken the boy to have lost him.</span> </p><p> <span>“Now, let’s get working on your background!” Jiraiya boomed trying to lighten the mood. Arashi chuckled and nodded.</span> </p><p> <span>~</span> </p><p> </p><p> <span>“Settle down Class!” Iruka called. The unruly students didn’t do as told and Iruka’s temper snapped. “SHUT IT!” He shouted. Everyone settled down and Iruka sighed. “I swear.” he murmured before clearing his throat.</span> </p><p> <span>“I’d like to introduce you all to a new student joining us today.” Iruka waved at the door, and it hesitantly opened before a boy with golden blonde hair and blue eyes walked in nervously. His hair was just long enough to be in a partial updo tail at the crown of his hair. On his cheeks were six whisker like scars.</span> </p><p> <span>“Students, this is Arashi-san. Arashi-san, how about you introduce yourself to the class? Likes, dislikes, dreams, the works.”</span> </p><p> <span>The blonde nodded and bowed a greeting. “Hello, I am Arashi. I do not know my family name. I’ve been an orphan for as long as i can remember. A shinobi of konoha found me and said i had the makings of a shinobi so he offered to sponsor me to be one of Konoha. I uhh...I like reading, gardening, and staring at the stars. I don’t like large crowds. My hobbies are calligraphy and exploring. I hope to make friends and my dream is to be a good shinobi.” He bowed again at the end. “Please take care of me.”</span> </p><p> <span>Iruka clapped with the others. “Well done Arashi-san. Konoha is always welcome to new blood to our forces. I’ll talk with your sponsor about tutoring to make sure you are caught up in class.”</span> </p><p> <span>“Thank you Iruka-sensei.”</span> </p><p> <span>Iruka beamed at the polite boy. “You are welcome. Well, you can go ahead and grab a seat. Nara!” He shouted. Shikamaru jolted and sat up. “You can sit beside Shikamaru-san.”</span> </p><p> <span>Arashi nodded and quickly went to his seat and got his supplies ready for Iruka’s lecture. If he eyed the empty seat on his other side, it was missed by mostly everyone.</span> </p><p> <span>“I’m not taking anyone’s seat right?” He whispered to the Nara boy.</span> </p><p> <span>The plump boy on Shikamaru’s other side chuckled. “No. There aren’t really any assigned seats. I’m Akimichi Choji. This is Nara Shikamaru.”</span> </p><p> <span>“Nice to meet you.” Arashi smiled.</span> </p><p> <span>“What’s with the whiskers?” The wild looking boy a row down turned and asked bluntly.</span> </p><p> <span>Arashi winced and covered them up. “Birthmarks.” He whispered anxiety skyrocketing. Kiba twitched his nose and felt contrite at making the new guy smell so anxious.</span> </p><p> <span>“Too bad. Thought they were tattoos.” He pointed to his own cheeks with a grin. “See? These are clan markings. Maybe your family has similar birthmarks?”</span> </p><p> <span>Arashi shrugged and looked down at his fingers nervously. “I...I don’t know. People only think I’m a demon. The village i was born in was near konoha...so people think i was exposed to the kyuubi chakra….they always think i’m a demon because i have whiskers.” He whispered blue eyes watering.</span> </p><p> <span>“That’s stupid.” Kiba stated bluntly.</span> </p><p> <span>“I must agree.” Shikamaru grunted. “If it was true we’d all have those since we were born in Konoha.”</span> </p><p> <span>“PAY ATTENTION!” Iruka shouted from upfront, four pieces of chalk flying for their heads. Arashi, used to dodging projectiles ducked in time. The other three not so much.</span> </p><p> <span>“Ow! Sensei!” Kiba whined.</span> </p><p> <span>“Inuzuka Kiba, you of all people need to pay attention! You failed the last test on this subject. Or do i need to inform your mother?”</span> </p><p> <span>Kiba paled and turned around quickly. “No sensei!”</span> </p><p> <span>Iruka sighed and shook his head. “You all will have plenty of time at lunch to talk with Arashi-san. For now we need to continue your lessons-”</span> </p><p> <span>A blur of red rushed into the room and froze when Iruka’s gaze whipped to the redheaded boy in an orange t-shirt and black pants. There was paint on his cheek and a guilty look in his eyes.</span> </p><p> <span>Iruka narrowed his own. “Uzumaki, what have you been up to? Class started twenty minutes ago.”</span> </p><p> <span>“Sorry Sensei! My alarm didn’t go off and then i had to dodge the police for switching their coffee again.”</span> </p><p> <span>Iruka just sighed. “To your seat Naruto.”</span> </p><p> <span>“Hai!” The redhead beamed walked past the desks until he stopped at his normal seat beside shikamaru because he’d been the only one to talk to him at the entrance ceremony, only to find it taken. “Who’re you?”</span> </p><p> <span>“Arashi?” The blonde said startled.</span> </p><p> <span>Naruto tilted his head before grinning. “I’m Naruto Uzumaki, Dattebayo!”</span> </p><p> <span> Arashi just stared. “Nice. Can...Can you please sit down? I’m new here and don’t want to miss anything.”</span> </p><p> <span>“Oh, sure.” Naruto muttered and plopped down in a seat beside him. </span> </p><p> <span>The class resumed and Arashi took meticulous notes. Shikamaru slept on one side and Naruto barely stayed awake on the other side.</span> </p><p> <span>Only when lunch time came did the two sleeping boys wake.</span> </p><p> <span>“Food!” naruto cheered and looked to his seatmates. “Ramen?!”</span> </p><p> <span>“No.” Shikamaru declined.</span> </p><p> <span>“Sorry Naruto, Ka-san made us bentos.” Choji shrugged.</span> </p><p> <span>“Oh...I...I forgot to buy lunch.” Arashi bit his lip. “I didn’t want to be late.”</span> </p><p> <span>“No worries!” Naruto beamed. “Ichiruka’s isn’t far. Do you like ramen?”</span> </p><p> <span>“I don’t think i’ve ever had-” Arashi started even as Kiba and Choji waved their hands to stop. “-it” the blonde finished confused.</span> </p><p> <span>Naruto beamed and suddenly he was halfway out the door and dragged around Konoha until they were sitting at bar stools.</span> </p><p> <span>“Teuchi-oji! Two bowls of Miso Pork! What would you like, Arashi-san?”</span> </p><p> <span>Looking at his hopefully new friend Naruto and Arashi missed the startled and wide-eyed looks the two Chefs had as they looked at the redheaded and golden blonde boys.</span> </p><p> <span>Ayame leaned closer to her father and whispered as softly as she could, knowing that Naruto had good ears. “Did kushina have twins?”</span> </p><p> <span>Teuchi just shrugged until they were both caught in identical blue eyes. Both boys then put fingers to their lips and matching grins appeared.</span> </p><p> <span>“Na...ru...to?” Teuchi asked slowly.</span> </p><p> <span>Arashi was the one to look around before slapping down a privacy seal. “Hey Teuchi-oji.” The Blonde smiled softly. “This one’s a clone.” He jerked a thumb to ‘Naruto’ who waved. “Jiji did it to protect me. This is how i actually look. But you can’t tell anyone. This way people can’t mess with my learning at the academy anymore. Jiji says it’s my first mission.”</span> </p><p> <span>Teuchi let out a sigh of relief. “You scared me there Naruto- or is it Arashi?”</span> </p><p> <span>“My birth name is Arashi. Jiji told me just before Academy started. When i told him about the previous sabotaging the other teachers did, he made up this plan so i could still learn.”</span> </p><p> <span>“Won’t people be upset though when one of you leave?” Ayame asked, being a retired Chuunin herself and seeing that one of the two persona’s would eventually be dropped.</span> </p><p> <span>Arashi shrugged. “Well… I’ll cross that bridge later. Jiji said it’s also for my safety. So, the old man is really smart and his plan is cool. Why go against it? Plus he promised to explain more when i make Genin.”</span> </p><p> <span>“Alright.” Ayame sighed.</span> </p><p> <span>“So, make sure you guys keep Arashi and Naruto separate ok?” Naruto smirked.</span> </p><p> <span>Teuchi chuckled. “Can do boys.”</span> </p><p> <span>Arashi pulled the tag away. “A bowl of beef Ramen with extra egg please.”</span> </p><p> <span>“Coming right up!” Teuchi laughed.</span> </p><p> <span>~</span> </p><p> <span>The following time at the Academy passed with Arashi and Naruto becoming fast friends. Seals hidden on the Clone and Arashi that kept a permanent genjutsu laid upon them. Nothing harmful, just something that would keep most people from ‘seeing’ how much they looked alike.</span> </p><p> <span>With the two boys as friends, they were quick to drag as many of their other classmates into their fold. Choji, Kiba, and Shikamaru were the first. They attempted to pull Sasuke in but the Uchiha boy was obsessed with catching and killing the man that murdered part of his clan.</span> </p><p> <span>Neither acknowledged the terrifying fact that the ‘fangirls’ of their class were split between Sasuke and his mysterious aura and Arashi’s kind and Golden boy looks. Especially since he was reaching quickly to being one of the best of their year. It was Arashi’s second year of the academy that he pulled the shy Hyuuga girl into their mix. Seeing her as a sister he wanted to protect. Him and Naruto helping her over that second year of the more shinobi focused training to help her confidence. Her crush on Naruto falling away to admiration of a close friend.</span> </p><p> <span>If he hid out in her compound when hiding from the Pair Patrols, Hinata just stared the first time. Arashi had just panted before trying to strangle his friend for dragging him into his pranking mess. Naruto just cackled and Hinata just sighed at the two best friends.</span> </p><p> <span>And so the time passed quickly for Arashi and Naruto as they trained ‘together’ and made friends. Naruto was still sabotaged even with Arashi’s help in tutoring him.</span> </p><p> <span>The only class that both boys excelled in above all else was the fuuinjutsu course. Iruka had been shocked at their perfect scores.</span> </p><p> <span>“They make sense.” Naruto admitted nervously. “All the other words turn around on me but Sealing...makes sense. I dunno how else to describe it sensei.”</span> </p><p> <span>“It’s like calligraphy.” Arashi answered next. “It’s pretty. it’s like painting a picture or poem but Sealing is just like it but with intriguing symbols.” The blonde shrugged.</span> </p><p> <span>Iruka decided to then help the boys after classes by supervising their independent studies of any additional sealing lessons they took. Iruka was surprised that they were advancing in an art he was only intermediately good at himself. Soon he could only leave them up to self study and sworn oaths to have him nearby for any testing.</span> </p><p> <span>Iruka had come to adore both boys that acted more like brothers over the years as their teacher. He’d heard Arashi’s story about being treated like a demon for his birthmarks. He knew Naruto’s own story and was sad he’d been a part of it before he’d had a reality check. Now he could see how parallel the boys’ lives were. He understood why they got along so well. Even if their personalities were polar opposites.</span> </p><p> <span>So as the students reached their final year of the Academy, Iruka prepared for the Final exam. </span> </p><p> <span>He knew Arashi would be taking the Shinobi of the year spot. But he worried for Naruto. The boy had tried taking the exams twice already. Wanting to be a shinobi. Arashi had taken them with his friend but chose to stay when Naruto failed. Claiming he wasn’t ready.</span> </p><p> <span>Now it was Naruto’s final try. Iruka worried for the boy.</span> </p><p> <span>Sadly his worry was proven when his combined scores couldn’t save him and his Bushin doomed him.</span> </p><p> <span>~</span> </p><p> <span>Naruto sat with the forbidden scroll in hand, Jutsu excuse in hand, and his original finally arriving.</span> </p><p> <span>The blonde skid to a stop. “This is not a good idea.” Arashi frowned.</span> </p><p> <span>Naruto shrugged. “It’s going to look strange otherwise.” He whispered back.</span> </p><p> <span>“We’ll need to increase the seal, bind you to me so you can work off my reserves.” Arashi whispered as they sat together, keeping their voices low, so the approaching Iruka wouldn’t hear them.</span> </p><p> <span>Naruto nodded and glanced to the woods. “Back to acting?”</span> </p><p> <span>Arashi nodded and the duo returned to hushed whispers as Iruka crashed into the clearing.</span> </p><p> <span>“Naruto!” Iruka stumbled when he found a teary Naruto and wincing Arashi. “Naruto? Arashi?”</span> </p><p> <span>“I told Naruto that he was tricked. There is no extra credit. I would know, i’ve read all the graduation requirements.”</span> </p><p> <span>“But mi-Mizuki sensei said-!” The Uzumaki stuttered.</span> </p><p> <span>“Mizuki!” iruka exclaimed before twitching and lunging for the boys and scroll. “Traitor!” Iruka shouted at said Chuunin who’d thrown Kunai at the boys with malicious glee. </span> </p><p> </p><p> <span>As Arashi watched history unfold, He stood protectively in front of his ‘friend’. Even when Mizuki revealed the Kyuubi secret.</span> </p><p> <span>“Naruto is no more a demon than I am.” Arashi snapped. “If the Yondaime sealed it within him, then he is just the container, not the fox. Both of us have studied enough sealing to know that difference. Hell it’s basic sealing 101.” Arashi smirked cruelly. “Looks like you’re the idiot here Mizuki.”</span> </p><p> <span>Enraged, Mizuki threw a fuma at them, but Iruka got in the way again, Arashi and Naruto would not let their sensei sacrifice himself again. They jumped almost in sync to block it with Kunai or their hands. Naruto’s Solid Henge being altered years ago to be a blood clone when Arashi had finally figured it out. It was needed with Taijutsu lessons and to keep suspicion from why ‘Naruto’ didn’t bleed. Thus the problem was resolved. Now to fix the chakra capacity amount to make it long term. Maybe a telepathic bond? Arashi shook his head and focused as Naruto defended his sensei then shocked Mizuki with the Kage bushin.</span> </p><p> <span>Naruto earned his headband that night.</span> </p><p> <span>~</span> </p><p> <span>Hiruzen just deadpanned the blonde and redhead in his office. He’d already heard their reports and sent everyone away but their guards. The barrier went up and hiruzen sighed.</span> </p><p> <span>“I thought we were in agreement Arashi, to have Naruto fail and be bait within the village. Now we are left with an odd number of graduating genin.”</span> </p><p> <span>“Then keep us together.” Naruto snorted. Both boys practically a split personality all these years later, yet still the same person.</span> </p><p> <span>“He’s got a point. Plus i kinda want to fuck with Kakashi’s mind.” Arashi smirked. “I don’t think the genjutsu seal will work long on him. I want to see if he can figure it out. Especially since he knew Ka-san’s choice in Names, but Tou-san’s as well.”</span> </p><p> <span>“Please don’t drive my shinobi insane. We need them.” Hiruzen stated dryly.</span> </p><p> <span>Both boys just gave matching foxy grins. Something they only did when with those in the know. Hiruzen shivered.</span> </p><p> <span>“This is going to be a bigger operation than before.” Hiruzen grunted. “Alright, Team seven will remain as it was with the addition of a fourth genin. Thankfully everyone does know how close Arashi and Naruto are and how in my soft years wouldn’t want to separate naruto from his best friend. You can be very vindictive when pranking.” He muttered and made the final assignments. “The team is going to be unbalanced at first. But if i can prove that four person teams with a captain can work, it will be easier for when you bring tsuna back for her medic program.”</span> </p><p> <span>Naruto and Arashi nodded.</span> </p><p> <span>“So, how long will you two keep this up?” Hiruzen asked.</span> </p><p> <span>“Until ‘Naruto’ Dies.” Arashi answered. “Or myself. I’m looking to make a seal that links us closer so that he doesn’t run out of chakra as easily and maybe links our minds for better communication. I’m a master at switching with clones and transformations, so we can always switch if it comes to that so my actual body doesn’t die. Maybe even put in a suicide bomb for who ever was stupid enough to kill a jinchuriki or attempt to extract the fox…”Arashi mused aloud.</span> </p><p> <span>“And how do you feel about this?” Hiruzen asked Naruto.</span> </p><p> <span>The redhead blinked. “Oh, i have absolutely no survival instincts. Thus my recklessness. All our clones are like that. That is how i know i’m not actually a real person even though i bleed. While seals protect the rest of our natures, i know i’m bait and a sacrifice. I’m just a clone made of chakra and seals. Boss is the one with the soul.”</span> </p><p> <span>“And when the secret is ever found out, we’ll tell a partial truth. I was taught how to make naruto at a young age when you deemed me ready. It was my first mission to protect myself and the kyuubi. I’ve only improved upon the plan as I studied and got older. Eventually it will be revealed that Uzumaki Naruto and Namikaze Arashi are the same person. One is just a mask to protect the other.” The Blonde shrugged.</span> </p><p> <span>Hiruzen sighed, rubbing his temples. He could just predict the shitstorm this would make when it came time to reveal it. He could only pray he could have them bring tsunade back before he had to deal with it.</span> </p><p> <span>~</span> </p><p> <span>“Team eight, Hinata Hyuuga, Inuzuka Kiba, Aburame Shino. Team nine is in rotation. Team ten, Nara Shikamaru, Yamanaka Ino, Akimichi Choji.”</span> </p><p> <span>“Sensei!” Sakura held up her hand. Iruka waved her off.</span> </p><p> <span>“I have saved team seven for last because we have an odd team match up this year. The Hokage knows of Arashi and Uzumaki Naruto’s teamwork and didn’t want to break up the pair. But that still left two students without a third. Since we do not have enough Jounin that volunteered, the Hokage chose to instead create the first five man Genin Cell. Arashi and Naruto will be joined by Uchiha Sasuke and Haruno Sakura.”</span> </p><p> <span>“The top three students are on the same team with the deadlast?” A civilian scoffed. “That’s not a disaster waiting to happen.”</span> </p><p> <span>Sakura however, was blushing up a storm. She was on a team with both of the popular boys? Sure Arashi was kind to the girls, but mostly brushed them off to hang with the loser Naruto.</span> </p><p> <span>She glanced at Ino to see the blonde glaring jealously at her. Sakura just shot her a smug smirk.</span> </p><p> <span>“Settle down. Now, your senseis will be here to pick you up soon. Behave and good luck.” Iruka was gone in a shunshin.</span> </p><p> <span>~</span> </p><p> <span>Arashi lifted just his eyes from the fuuinjutsu theory book to watch as Naruto finally broke. Jumping up he lept from desk to desk until he was at the front of the classroom.</span> </p><p> <span>“Naruto.” Arashi said with a cool and Calm warning tone.</span> </p><p> <span>“It’s been three fucking hours. Future sensei-san has it coming.” The Uzumaki reasoned back.</span> </p><p> <span>“Naruto!” Sakura scolded.</span> </p><p> <span>“Don’t get us in trouble Dobe.” Sasuke scoffed. While he wasn’t a depressed half insane and traumatized idiot. The revenge obsession was still there to get back at the Kinslayer. With an inferiority complex thrown in there battling with his brother complex. So Sasuke was more talkative than Arashi remembered, but also much happier. With Itachi running the Clan and Police Force, Sasuke had been left to train alone though and have an arrogant streak a mile long. He respected Arashi but disliked Naruto.</span> </p><p> <span>Naruto ignored the Uchiha like he always did. He did not need a rivalry with the Uchiha to make him feel connected. He’d earn his friendship later. This ‘naruto’ had Arashi at his side. Which in a way was nice, even if it was himself. But he also had his guard, the Ichiruka’s, jiji, and Ero-sennin. That and he had his friends in the other Clan heirs. He didn’t </span> <em> <span>need</span> </em> <span> sasuke’s friendship if the boy didn’t want it.</span> </p><p> <span>“You only get in trouble if you get caught.” The Uzumaki recited his mantra he’d taken up this life.</span> </p><p> <span>Arashi snorted amused looking back down. “Amplification seal, sticky seal.” He suggested.</span> </p><p> <span>Naruto paused in putting the storage seal on with the extra chalk dust. “Good Idea.” The Uzumaki cheered, and quickly inked them on the eraser before putting it in place. He jumped back to sit back with arashi and look over where he was in the theory books jiji had learnt them.</span> </p><p> <span>“Oh! Is that gravity seals?” He grinned. “Jiji’s letting us move onto the SL9 Theory now?”</span> </p><p> <span>“Uh huh.” Arashi answered absently already deep into the book, only absently allowing Naruto to read with him.</span> </p><p> <span>The sound of the door sliding open was met with a small thump.</span> </p><p> <span>Four sets of eyes moved to the Jounin. A pop and the small dust could exploded into a bigger one.</span> </p><p> <span>Kakashi’s shoulders dropped even as he reached up to grab the eraser, but felt it stuck.</span> </p><p> <span>“I hate you. Roof five minutes.” He called and disappeared in a chalky shunshin.</span> </p><p> <span>The four genin paused. “One eye.” Naruto noted.</span> </p><p> <span>“White chakra.” Arashi supplied.</span> </p><p> <span>“Hatake Kakashi.” The best friends said aloud before Naruto’s turned to an excited grin.</span> </p><p> <span>“Awesome.” Grabbing arashi, they raced out with Sakura and Sasuke quickly joining them.</span> </p><p><br /> <br /> </p><p> <span>Kakashi himself was internalizing his mini panic attack when the dust cloud had cleared and he found his students staring at him. But it was two that threw him into memories and panic. Uzumaki Naruto was sensei’s son...but that Arashi kid...he hadn’t really looked at the files hokage-sama gave him, so he hadn’t been expecting a practical Mini Minato sitting beside a Mini Kushina. Fuck….was he finally losing his sanity? Kushina-nee was only pregnant with one kid...he could have sworn that it was Naruto. Sensei had loved that name.</span> </p><p> <em> <span>He pushed away the memories of Kushina arguing that she wanted to name their baby after her father, not a ramen topping. She loved the food, but she didn’t want her son to be bullied.</span> </em> <span> He hadn’t stayed to see if Minato had convinced her otherwise and had just believed Hokage-sama when he told him where Naruto lived….once Kakashi pulled his head out of his ass. By then Naruto was seven and Konoha’s prankster. He heard Rumors of how only the Uchiha could ever catch him, but it was getting harder and harder for them in recent years. None had really known why.</span> </p><p> <span>Kakashi had a hint after hearing the reports on his students. (the name hadn’t clicked at first.) Arashi was Shinobi of the year and Uzumaki Naruto’s best friend. Was it possible that he’d been dragged in as an accomplice?</span> </p><p> <span>Kakashi was pulled from his panic and thoughts when his four students settled down. Kami who thought giving him a tester team like this was a good idea? Three top students and a hyperactive deadlast?</span> </p><p> <span>“Introduce yourselves. Likes, dislikes, hobbies, dreams.”</span> </p><p> <span>“Ne, Sensei can you give us an example?” The pink haired fangirl asked trying to look cute. He noticed how Naruto and Arashi shared exasperated looks and Sasuke grimaced at her display.</span> </p><p> <span>“Hatake Kakashi. You don’t need to know my likes or dislikes. I have adult hobbies, and I don’t really have a dream.” He stated without looking up from his book. “Pinky go first.”</span> </p><p> <span>Kakashi tuned the fan girl out as she looked mostly at Sasuke, but paused as she looked at Arashi. Yet exclaiming hate for Naruto who just blew a raspberry at her in retaliation.</span> </p><p> <span>“You next Chibi Uchiha.”</span> </p><p> <span>“Uchiha Sasuke. I like my family, clan, and training. I dislike fangirls and idiots. My hobbies are training with Nii-san and ignoring Shisui. I don’t have a dream but an ambition to kill the man that murdered my clansmen.”</span> </p><p> <span>Kakashi just stared and held back the whine in his voice. </span> <em> <span>Why him?</span> </em> </p><p> <span>“Red. Your turn.”</span> </p><p> <span>“Yo! I’m Uzumaki Naruto, I like my friends, training, and RAMEN!” He shouted. “I dislike those who judge others for things not their fault. My hobbies are pranking, studying Fuuinjutsu with Arashi, and gardening. My dream is to be Hokage!”</span> </p><p> <span>“Blondie.” Kakashi sighed.</span> </p><p> <span>“I’m Arashi. I like my friends, reading, and training to get stronger.” He hummed calmly and contemplatively. “I don’t have too much i dislike. Only those that are mean to my best friend unwarranted. My hobbies are star gazing, gardening, fuuinjutsu, and keeping track of Naruto. My dream is….” He looked to Naruto. “To protect my precious people.”</span> </p><p> <span>Naruto glanced back and Beamed.</span> </p><p> <span>Kakashi raised a brow at the mature boy but nodded. “Best introduction yet. Now, let’s move on about your test.”</span> </p><p> <span>“Test!” the four asked stunned and Kakashi internally cackled at the shock on their faces as he told them about the second genin test and only 33% would pass. He left them with where and when, along with instructions to skip breakfast. Disappearing, he watched as Sakura first looked at Sasuke.</span> </p><p> <span>When the uchiha denied her a date, she looked to Arashi. “Arashi-san would you like to-”</span> </p><p> <span>“Sorry Sakura-san, but Naruto owes me Ramen.”</span> </p><p> <span>“Ehhh?!?!” The Redhead whined. “Why-”</span> </p><p> <span>Arashi just deadpanned him. “Scroll.”</span> </p><p> <span>Naruto just pouted. “but...I already apologized for that.”</span> </p><p> <span>“You still used up the best sealing scroll i’d found in Konoha just to hide those paints and repelling gear. I was saving it for my first SM seal.”</span> </p><p> <span>“Sorry Arashi.” Naruto murmured before smirking. “But, how did you like the Mountain?” He asked as they both unintentionally (mostly intentionally tuned Sakura out until she left)</span> </p><p> <span>When she was gone, Arashi punched Naruto’s arm to shut him up. “She’s gone.”</span> </p><p> <span>The grin dropped from Naruto’s face as he sighed. “With you and Sasuke around she’ll never see anyone else.” He pouted.</span> </p><p> <span>“I keep telling you that Hinata would be a better choice.” Arashi sighed.</span> </p><p> <span>Naruto wrinkled his nose. “She’s nice, she’s come a long way since she joined the gang, but...i don’t know. I don’t want to drag her into the dirt because of the fox.”</span> </p><p> <span>Arashi shrugged and pulled out his theory book and a copy for Naruto. “Well, we both know my preference so we aren’t expected anywhere for a while. Read.”</span> </p><p> <span>Naruto groaned but did as told.</span> </p><p> <span>They leaned against each other’s backs for almost an hour as Kakashi watched them. Kakashi was kinda surprised that Naruto was so...still. He’d heard reports that it was hard for the boy to do. Yet here he sat for an hour, focused and reading.</span> </p><p> <span>“Ne, Arashi…” Naruto called and Kakashi paid attention at the serious note in the preteen’s voice. “Do you think we can reach our dreams?”</span> </p><p> <span>Arashi just smiled a small smile and knocked his head back against Naruto’s. </span> </p><p> <span>“Itai!” The redhead yelped rocking to the ground.</span> </p><p> <span>“Baka. Of course we will. Come on, let’s go get food. We’ve heard about Hatake’s tests from previous failed senpais. We need to plot manipulating the arrogant Uchiha and Fangirl to work with us.”</span> </p><p> <span>“You mean work with me.” Naruto pouted practically stomping beside the Blonde.</span> </p><p> <span>“Tomato Tomahto.” Arashi chuckled. “Race ya.”</span> </p><p> <span>And just like that the blonde took off at impressive speeds for a genin. Naruto’s shout echoing in the air as he chased after the blonde.</span> </p><p> <span>That feeling from before came roaring back in kakashi’s head along with alarm bells. They had to be twins...unknowing twins...but...but Arashi was just so Minato. Naruto was so Kushina-nee. How….How is this possible?</span> </p><p> <span>Kakashi bit his lip behind his mask and decided to wait until after the test to see if his theories were right. Maybe even steal hair samples while he was at it. He had a medic that owed him a favor….</span> </p><p> <span>~</span> </p><p> <span>Kakashi stared down at the four Genin before him. The test had gone about what he’d predicted after looking over their files finally last night. Sasuke was a typical Uchiha trained Genin. He was practically low chuunin already except he was missing essential foundations and teamwork skills. Let alone experience. He left the arrogant brat buried in dirt to think about his mistakes.</span> </p><p> <span>Sakura had been the weakest of them all. She was booksmart, tiny reserves that couldn’t even fight off a D-rank Genjutsu. Her strength and stamina was non-existent. She was tied to the post.</span> </p><p> <span>Now....the two boys he theorized were twins separated at birth? They had surprised him with their teamwork. Naruto had trapped a good portion of the woods, and Arashi had been the one to try to lead Kakashi into it. Naruto’s clones being used as shields, distractions, and extra support.</span> </p><p> <span>Then the duo had joined together to try a trapped seal explosion on him. Thankfully he was a jounin. He ignored the cinders he had had to pat out on his vest.</span> </p><p> <span>Then the two brats appeared out of nowhere both going at him head on and with excellent teamwork in their taijutsu and kunai handling.</span> </p><p> <span>He’d kept them from getting the bells, but just barely. Arashi could be damn quiet when he wanted to be. He’d almost forgotten the blonde because he was so busy with Naruto’s clones. And Naruto was incredibly an on the fly tactician Kakashi hadn’t seen since Minato-sensei. Arashi was the more patient one and planned the long game for their pair.</span> </p><p> <span>Hell, Kakashi was thinking of failing the other two and just keeping Naruto and Arashi. But then again there were </span> <em> <span>politics</span> </em> <span> with this team. Haruno was a Civilian counselor's daughter, and Sasuke was the son of one of the Renamed Advisor Council.</span> </p><p> <span>There was no doubt Asuma and Kurenai felt the same. With Chouza’s brother on the council and Hizashi there as well.</span> </p><p> <span>Kakashi absently told the brats where they had went wrong. He was surprised that Naruto was the one that figured it out.</span> </p><p> <span>“Teamwork. Sensei we tried!” The Redhead sighed and glared at the tied up kunoichi and the glaring Sasuke.</span> </p><p> <span>“Naruto is right Sensei. We woke up Sakura and unburied Sasuke while Naruto’s clones kept you busy. Sakura tried to punch Naruto for saying that sasuke needed our help.”</span> </p><p> <span>“The Teme just ignored us.” Naruto grunted. “Didn’t even thank us for unburrying him.”</span> </p><p> <span>Kakashi raised a brow under his hidden side. “Well, you two already worked well as a team. You probably would have messed up if you added them in so suddenly anyways.”</span> </p><p> <span>The Jounin let his mind wander as he went on about how it didn’t matter and they failed. After some bickering and shouting, kakashi made a deal with them and left to see what they would do.</span> </p><p> <span>To his surprise the blonde and Uzumaki weren’t the ones to make the first move. Sure they made faces at each other as they ate slowly. Making subtle gestures to Sakura and Sasuke, but they didn’t move. Not until after </span> <em> <span>Sasuke</span> </em> <span> moved. He waited and watched as the Uchiha offered his food. Naruto cut her free and Arashi handed over his bento to Sasuke.</span> </p><p> <span>“Naruto and I ate Breakfast and second breakfast before arriving. We aren’t hungry. We also aren’t stupid enough to diet or listen to a man that made a stupid suggestion. Everyone knows how many calories Shinobi and Kunoichi burn. Dieting and skipping meals stunts your growth and makes you weak. Not to mention you’ll never grow your reserves without proper food.” Arashi informed his teammates. “Just ask Naruto. Until i moved here, he was living off Ramen. Once i moved here and started staying over at his place to make him eat right, he shot up like a weed.”</span> </p><p> <span>Naruto just nodded. “Arashi’s a great cook. But he only feeds me if i keep my place clean. Speaking of which!” Naruto snapped to his best friend. “Ramen!”</span> </p><p> <span>Arashi snorted. “After the Exam. We have to get fangirl and duckass to listen to us.”</span> </p><p> <span>“Oi!” Sasuke growled.</span> </p><p> <span>“Your hair looks like a duck’s ass. Everyone knows this.” Naruto snorted. “The adults are too proper to tell you, the fangirls are too in obsession with you. The guys just like laughing at it.”</span> </p><p> <span>Sasuke glared. Arashi bumped Naruto’s shoulder. “Don’t antagonized him so much that he won't work together.”</span> </p><p> <span>The Redhead just rolled his eyes and handed over his own lunch when he noticed Sakura had finished hers and was drooling at his.</span> </p><p> <span>“Eat. Then we need to plan.” Naruto stated sighing. “This is going to be so much harder than pranking the ANBU.”</span> </p><p> <span>“It’s just one Jounin though.” Sakura said after a bite.</span> </p><p> <span>“One of Konoha’s remaining borderline S-rank Jounin.” Arashi deadpanned.</span> </p><p> <span>“How do you know that?” Sasuke grumbled.</span> </p><p> <span>“Snatched my sponsor’s bingo book from his pouch.” The blonde shrugged.</span> </p><p> <span>“Sponsor?” Sakura asked.</span> </p><p> <span>“Yeah, Shirunai Genma found me and had me brought to the village. Said i had potential.” He waved to the general situation. “Here i am now.”</span> </p><p> <span>“Don’t let him fool you.” Naruto snorted. “Genma-san is a mother-hen and visits his apartment regularly to make sure he’s keeping it clean, stocked, and not being bullied. He would help us with our homework whenever I stayed over. Cool guy.”</span> </p><p> <span>Arashi opened his mouth to defend his sponsor before he snapped it shut and jumped to his feet alert. Naruto a moment ahead of him. Both boys were ready to defend their distracted teammates when Kakashi arrived in a cloud of smoke and mild KI.</span> </p><p> <span>“YOU GUYS!!!” He snarled. “You weren’t supposed to feed SAKURA!”</span> </p><p> <span>Sasuke finally joined the two boys already up. “We’re supposed to fight you as a team. We can’t do that if everyone doesn’t have enough energy!”</span> </p><p> <span>“A-a-and you said we’re a team.” Sakura finally stood up and faced her fear. “I won’t just stand around again. I want to help.”</span> </p><p> <span>“And you two?”</span> </p><p> <span>“We protect our comrades.” They said in unison, making Kakashi’s eye twitch. The hair samples in his pockets were extra heavy at that synced response.</span> </p><p> <span>“Fine...You all…..Pass~” Kakashi eye smiled.</span> </p><p> <span>Sakura face faulted. Sasuke’s jaw dropped. Naruto and arashi stared. “Ehhhhh?!?!?!?!” Naruto shouted while Arashi’s face filled with relief.</span> </p><p> <span>Kakashi felt a spark in his fire as he taught the fresh genin the first important lesson he would bestow upon them after a short lecture on their exams.</span> </p><p> <span>“Those who break the rules are trash. But those who abandon their comrades are worse than trash.” He eyed the two blue eyed boys and noted the similar eyes. Something tingled around them...around his mind, and a short chakra spike with a mental ‘Kai’, and whatever genjutsu kept brushing against his mind was released again. He’d been playing the genjutsu game since meeting the boys.</span> </p><p> <span>“You two, i see already live by a similar code. I’m very proud to have students with such strong convictions. Now, we will meet here tomorrow same time and begin your serious training. In a few days we will get started with missions with the rest of your agemates. Dismissed.”</span> </p><p> <span>Once the four were Gone, Kakashi stopped at the hospital and slipped down to the labs.</span> </p><p> <span>Shunpei jumped at the sudden arrival of one of his most notorious patients from the ANBU. “Fucking hell Hatake. What are you doing in my cave?” The grumpy Doctor hissed out.</span> </p><p> <span>Kakashi ignored the remark about the personal office/ lab. Instead he handed over the two vials of hair. One blonde, one red.</span> </p><p> <span>“I need you to run DNA matches to these.”</span> </p><p> <span>Shunpei shrugged and took them. “Sure. Who am i running them up against?”</span> </p><p> <span>“Each other.” Kakashi supplied and Shunpei met the other man’s single eye. After a beat Hatake continued. “I’m calling in that favor you owe me. This doesn’t leave you and me. And if the results leak or you try to figure out who’s hair that is, you will disappear.”</span> </p><p> <span>“Geeze.” Shunpei grunted glaring. “No need to threaten. Since i don’t know names, and i’m just running them against each other, they will be labeled A and B.”</span> </p><p> <span>“How long until you get the results?”</span> </p><p> <span>“An hour if i make it a priority.”</span> </p><p> <span>“Make it a priority. Depending on the results,....I have questions for the Hokage.”</span> </p><p> <span>Shunpei raised a brow but didn’t question it. He just turned and went to work. Kakashi disappeared and took the long way to the Hokage’s office. If he timed it right he could stop at the hospital for the results before reporting just before it was too late for the Jounin meeting.</span> </p><p> <span>~</span> </p><p> <span>Kakashi looked up from the test results an hour later. His visible skin gone ash gray. Shunpei raised a brow at him.</span> </p><p> <span>“I don’t make mistakes, don’t even dare question me. I already triple checked. They are identical with only a minor difference in their residue yin/yang balance. One has more yin, the other more yang.”</span> </p><p> <span>Kakashi ran a shaking hand through his hair. “Thanks Shunpei.”</span> </p><p> <span>“Consider my debt paid.”</span> </p><p> <span>“The samples and results but this one are destroyed?” Kakashi confirmed.</span> </p><p> <span>“I’m not an idiot.” Shunpei deadpanned. “If it’s as big as you’re hinting, of course I destroyed them. You hold the only results left. I didn’t even run it in the system. There’s no trace of the test ever being run.”</span> </p><p> <span>A part of kakashi relaxed at that. “Thanks. I...I need to go.” He disappeared in a shushin. He stopped long enough to stuff the results in his vest before pulling on his facade to face the hokage.</span> </p><p> <span>“AH, Kakashi, you’re just on time!” Hiruzen beamed, even his dark eyes narrowed on the still pale piece of flesh visible on his Jounin.</span> </p><p> <span>“Team six.”</span> </p><p> <span>“Fail.”</span> </p><p> <span>“Team Seven.”</span> </p><p> <span>“Pass.” Kakashi monotoned. Having not even pulled his book out. His mind was still too far gone at the revelation. Thus, the Hatake missed the ensuing silence of the room.</span> </p><p> <span>“Ahem, team eight.” </span> </p><p> <span>“Pass.”</span> </p><p> <span>“Team ten.”</span> </p><p> <span>“Pass.”</span> </p><p> <span>Kakashi listened as they were given a short speech and good luck with their students. When everyone had dismissed themselves, Kakashi stayed.</span> </p><p> <span>“You needed something Kakashi?”</span> </p><p> <span>“Privacy and silencing Barrier.” Kakashi choked out.</span> </p><p> <span>Hiruzen’s eyes narrowed but did as told. “Done.”</span> </p><p> <span>“I...I can only assume Sensei’s old guard knows, but how long were you going to keep me out of the loop?”</span> </p><p> <span>Hiruzen sighed. “When the boy was ready kakashi. It still baffles us that he’s such a good actor.”</span> </p><p> <span>Kakashi frowned. “What are you talking about?”</span> </p><p> <span>Hiruzen met his Shinobi’s eyes before narrowing again sharply. “Why are you here kakashi?”</span> </p><p> <span>Kakashi pulled the results out and tossed them at the Hokage. “When the fuck was anyone going to tell me that Naruto was a fucking twin!”</span> </p><p> <span>Hiruzen took the results and frowned. “What is this?”</span> </p><p> <span>“That is me following a hunch. I’ve been fighting off a genjutsu every time i am around Arashi and Naruto. Every time i have a clear moment, i can see it more and more. Naruto acts practically like Kushina, but with Minato’s tactics. Arashi is like a mini Minato, but Kushina’s ability to wait out her prey when she’s determined. Both boys are exceptional at sealing.”</span> </p><p> <span>Hiruzen looked back down at the results. “You took samples.”</span> </p><p> <span>“Hair.”</span> </p><p> <span>“And...and Naruto’s didn’t disappear?” Hiruzen whispered shocked.</span> </p><p> <span>“Why would it disappear?” Kakashi asked slowly.</span> </p><p> <span>“Silence.” Hiruzen ordered and Kakashi snapped to attention. The barrier dropped and the Hokage signaled for an ANBU. “Boar, get me Arashi and Naruto with Naruto’s guard. I want them here in no less than ten minutes. Cat, Jiraiya. He shouldn’t have taken off yet from our last meeting.”</span> </p><p> <span>“Hai!” The two ANBU saluted and were gone. Kakashi bit his tongue as the Hokage massaged his temples.</span> </p><p> <span>Within ten minutes both boys were present and pouting about Ramen on Naruto’s end. Ten minutes after that, Jiraiya raced in running from an angry Cat.</span> </p><p> <span>He stopped at the sight of the boys and kakashi. He could aso sense three extra anbu.</span> </p><p> <span>“Everyone but the summoned out.” Hiruzen ordered. His guard disappeared and Naruto’s guards instead took their posts. “Jiraiya.” He handed the results over after putting the Privacy seals up once more.</span> </p><p> <span>Jiraiya looked down and shrugged. “What about them?”</span> </p><p> <span>“How did a sample last long enough?”</span> </p><p> <span>Jiraiya looked at the preteens that were standing straight. “What did you do?”</span> </p><p> <span>Arashi shot Kakashi a look. “Is he in the know?”</span> </p><p> <span>“No. But after this he will have to be.” Hiruzen frowned. “Arashi explain. This shouldn’t even be possible. Blood cone or not.”</span> </p><p> <span>Arashi and Naruto shared looks. Naruto shrugged.</span> </p><p> <span>“Give me a minute.” The Blonde sat down and fell into meditation. Naruto’s blue eyes also went out of focus to the surprise of the others.</span> </p><p> </p><p> <span>“Kurama!” Arashi shouted as he entered the mindscape. “Do you know what’s going-” The blonde choked when instead of his whole companion, there was a dark and light furred foxes behind the same cage.</span> </p><p> <span>“Uhhh….. Not good.”</span> </p><p> <span>“You can say that again.” Arashi jumped when he found ‘Naruto’ beside him in the mental space. Both were in their adult forms, but with the colors of their current facades. Arashi carefully looked Naruto over and poked him a few times. But he was real and he...he wasn’t Dark Arashi.</span> </p><p> <span>“What the fuck?!” Arashi yelped. “Kurama!”</span> </p><p> <span>Both Foxes sighed. “We didn’t know how to tell you.” Dark Kurama grumbled.</span> </p><p> <span>“When you came back, we couldn’t merge.” Light Kurama continued. “We tried for years. But it wouldn’t work.”</span> </p><p> <span>“When you made your Naruto Clone, we decided to put one of us with him.” Yang shrugged.</span> </p><p> <span>“Being made of Yang Chakra, I went to Naruto. Yin Kurama stayed with Arashi.”</span> </p><p> <span>“Funny thing.” Yin scratched at his chin. “When you two went about messing with your chakra and seals into a bond, you didn’t take into account the Jinchuriki seal your pops made. Or really...Who he made it with.”</span> </p><p> <span>“The Shinigami.” Yang grinned as the boys just went slack jawed. “You Idiots forgot that we are connected by our souls. You die, we die. So in combination with us taking residence separately between the two of you…’Naruto’ became a living being.”</span> </p><p> <span>“He had all the requirements. Blood, Chakra, and a soul. Add the extra bonds you two did, you made your own twin.”</span> </p><p> <span>“But!” Naruto pointed to himself. “I have no self preservation instincts like the shadow clones! I know i was the Clone!”</span> </p><p> <span>“When You were made-” Yang said clearly “Arashi took every part of himself that he missed from his youth, and made ‘Naruto’s’ personality from it. Basically he took most of his Uzumakiness and made you. He kept the majority Namikaze for himself. Or in other words, his more mature personality. That way one of you could be childish and loud. And the other could be truer to themselves. Quiet, thoughtful, and anxious around large crowds.”</span> </p><p> <span>Arashi went a little numb. “I...I accidentally Cloned myself.” He finally admitted.</span> </p><p> <span>“Correct.” The Kuramas grinned as they felt the wheels turning and the impending storm brewing. Naruto even felt it and backed up. He might have most of the Uzumaki...but Namikaze genes should be feared for a reason.</span> </p><p> <span>With a scream Arashi exploded into a storm of expletives that made both Kyuubis’ jaws drop at the range and creativity.</span> </p><p> <span>Naruto couldn’t hold it back and burst out cackling. Arashi lept at him. They tussled until tails of light and dark separated them.</span> </p><p> <span>Naruto just beamed at his actual brother who was panting from the released storm of emotion.</span> </p><p> <span>“Ne, ne, that means we actually are brothers! We’ve never had family before! This will be so much better! We can get so much more done! Especially since our seals and minds are linked we can really become a kickass duo!”</span> </p><p> <span>Arashi couldn’t help the fond chuckles. He’d enjoyed Naruto’s company because it was always a reminder of the innocence that was there to fight for. Now,....now he could protect that. Now he would have someone he could trust at his back. Tears filled Arashi’s eyes. Naruto stopped his rambling about awesome combos and went to his now twin. Arashi fell into Naruto’s arms.</span> </p><p> <span>“Well...we never did stop being the most unpredictable Ninja of Konoha.” Arashi chuckled. “This is some freaky Uzumaki luck.”</span> </p><p> <span>“I think it’s Kami giving us a break. They knew we couldn’t do this alone. Just wait until Tou-san and Ka-san get to see they have two kids instead of one.”</span> </p><p> <span>Arashi chuckled and hugged...hugged his twin brother tighter. “I’m older.”</span> </p><p> <span>“Ma, i’ll let you get away with it since you think like the old man we once were.”</span> </p><p> <span>Arashi snorted but let his...brother get away with the jab. “Now we have to explain this to everyone.”</span> </p><p> <span>“Noooo~” Naruto whined.</span> </p><p> <span>The boys didn’t have a choice when they were kicked out of the seal by twin tails of the cackling foxes in their guts.</span> </p><p> <span>Arashi rapidly blinked as Naruto went stumbling forward and rubbed his head.</span> </p><p> <span>“Fucking Fuzzball. Rude much.”</span> </p><p> <span>“Fastest way to leave the Mindscape.” Arashi stated calmly as he stood smoothly and let out a long sigh. Blue eyes raked across the room meeting five that were in the know, and one eye that would now be in the know with extra knews.</span> </p><p> <span>“Good news. We’re fine.”</span> </p><p> <span>“Bad news, I’m alive.” Naruto smirked. “Yo~ I’m Uzumaki Naruto, younger twin to Namikaze Arashi. Arashi holds Yin Kurama. I hold Yang Kurama.”</span> </p><p> <span>Blank stares and a few blinks.</span> </p><p> <span>“What?” Hiruzen whispered.</span> </p><p> <span>Arashi smiled sheepish. “Uhh...well it seems like chakra bonding, blood clone preservation seals, telepathy bond seals, and a few other experimental seals do not mix well with the jinchuriki shiki fuin seal on a blood clone, especially when your bijuu partner with half your soul decides to reside in said blood clone.”</span> </p><p> <span>“But you’re the same person!” Jiraiya spluttered.</span> </p><p> <span>“Yes and no. We have the same memories of the future, but when i made Naruto and took the agreed role as Arashi, i put everything that i was as a kid and teen into the Blood clone to be that part of my personality that stopped showing up after i was eighteen. Everything from Eighteen on stayed with me. In simple terms,” he pointed to Naruto “Innocent immature.” Himself “Mature and wise for my age.”</span> </p><p> <span>“Are you calling me stupid?” naruto asked. Arashi just shot him a smirk.</span> </p><p> <span>“You did fail the exam for the sixth time.”</span> </p><p> <span>“Because it wasn’t worth answering anything when Mizuki was just going to change my answers anyways. I had a hell of a time with the shit balanced Kunai and shuriken as it was.”</span> </p><p> <span>“I know...Otouto~” Arashi smirked. Naruto stared before crossing his arms and pouting deeply.</span> </p><p> <span>“That is soooo not fair, Arashi.”</span> </p><p> <span>“Well, older brothers do tend to be more mature.” Genma teased from his corner. “Look at Itachi and Sasuke. Clan Head and arrogant Genin brat.”</span> </p><p> <span>Naruto sighed. “Touche.”</span> </p><p> <span>“I’m…..lost.” Kakashi whimpered out finally.</span> </p><p> <span>“Future Arashi came and took over baby naruto only days after he was born.” Hiruzen provided. “For the longest time i didn’t believe he remembered, until he was three and warned me of Kumo’s betrayal and the Hyuuga heir’s kidnapping. Before that we arranged to hide Arashi as Uzumaki Naruto. Arashi would arrive around academy age when he could make and keep a clone. With seals assisting it, Naruto was born. Then you just heard their explanation for how Naruto is actually now Arashi’s twin.”</span> </p><p> <span>“Technically i somehow cloned myself.” Arashi sighed. “Ya know, i got into some weird and impossible situations in our first life, but this is taking unpredictable to a new level.”</span> </p><p> <span>Naruto snorted. “Damn straight, dattebayo.”</span> </p><p> <span>Arashi rolled his eyes and eyed his teacher. “Naruto was supposed to fail and then just sit as bait for a crime organization after the bijuu. But we..changed...plans….” blue eyes snapped together as Naruto felt Arashi’s mental line of thinking.</span> </p><p> <span>“Ya know...that's probably why my gut kept screaming that i shouldn’t ‘pop’. I’d actually have died. Well fuck.”</span> </p><p> <span>“We’re going to have to respin your stories-” Hiruzen started.</span> </p><p> <span>“Why?” They asked in unison.</span> </p><p> <span>“You had us separated at birth.” Arashi said evenly. “To protect us. You had ANBU you trusted watching me unknowingly until you sent Genma to ‘sponsor’ a random orphan. It’s not your fault that you thought Tou-san only sealed the kyuubi in the more Uzumaki looking baby. It was the only part of the sealing you witnessed.”</span> </p><p> <span>“Kid’s got a point sensei.” Jiraiya hummed. “Not to mention...Arashi made Naruto look more like Minato in face and eye shape. Arashi kept his original looks which leans towards Kushina. I’ve heard no whispers of how he looks like Minato.”</span> </p><p> <span>“I’ve also stayed away from most of the Clans, keeping quiet and unnoticed.” Arashi pointed out. "To them we’re just names on reports right now."</span> </p><p> <span>“You’re really from the future?” Kakashi interrupted.</span> </p><p> <span>“Do you want us to give the next Icha Icha spoilers as proof?” Naruto smirked.</span> </p><p> <span>Jiraiya yelped and Kakashi twitched hard. “How...how do you know them?”</span> </p><p> <span>“Ero-sennin trained me for three years.” Arashi shrugged.</span> </p><p> <span>“Kakashi.” Hiruzen called. “Obviously this is not to be repeated to anyone. Arashi and Naruto only inform us when it’s necessary. And only the basic points of who, what and when. The Uchiha Incident in their time was actually the Uchiha massacre, plotted by danzo, committed by Itachi.”</span> </p><p> <span>“We did lose a spy in the Akatsuki though.” Arashi winced. “We won’t be able to predict their movements, but give good guesses based on their goals and targets.”</span> </p><p> <span>Hiruzen nodded. “We still need to talk more about this...Akatsuki. Jiraiya has provided me with reports of their movements as bounty hunters so far.”</span> </p><p> <span>“They’ll be actively hunting jinchuriki in a year.” Arashi sighed.</span> </p><p> <span>“We have a seal that can prevent extraction already on us. But...if Jiraiya gets to the others first? It can be put on them. The other Jinchuriki might still die, but at least the Akatsuki’s plans will be delayed at least a decade for the bijuu to reform again.”</span> </p><p> <span>“You’re okay with altering the future that much?” Kakashi asked slowly.</span> </p><p> <span>“It was War to end all Wars. There was nothing left. No hope left.” Arashi said sadly. “I...I accidentally found a memory repression seal in my mind and found out a trip in time part of squad seven took. I...I met my dad and a chibi you. I thought i could use it again, but when i looked at the seal and really thought about it, it would be too far back. I wouldn’t be able to predict the future. That and there was no guarantee it would work. So i based my own off of seals i found in Uzushio and the hiraishin. But it was a two part seal. Instead of staying in the time i chose as my adult self, i chose to instead save an innocent baby from a life of hate and instead lived a second life the way i wanted to.” He looked over to Naruto.</span> </p><p> <span>“Funnily enough i created my own brother and having him there at my side made things so much better. Even if I didn’t realize it at the time.”</span> </p><p> <span>“Plus Konoha has two jinchuriki now!” Naruto beamed with a peace sign held up.</span> </p><p> <span>Raidou choked, Genma slapped his back absently as that news hit all of them.</span> </p><p> <span>“Shit.” Iwashi murmured. “If that gets out, the other nations are going to be pissed.”</span> </p><p> <span>“Why?” Naruto asked confused.</span> </p><p> <span>“It’s still one bijuu.” Arashi finished.</span> </p><p> <span>“Just spit in two bodies.” Naruto shrugged smirking, knowing he’d won the point.</span> </p><p> <span>“Okay.” Hiruzen clapped to get attention back on him. “Kakashi is in the know that Arashi is from the future. We are all now aware that he cloned himself into his own twin. Naruto is alive. Both are the kyuubi’s jinchurikis. Arashi’s is going to remain ‘unknown’ until he accidentally uses it in the future. He’ll join naruto’s kyuubi training with jiraiya then. For now, the boys are Minato’s sons. Their blood ties are still S-ranked secrets. When it comes down to it to reveal those secrets, i can explain that Minato and Kushina kept it secret that they were actually having twins. That’s why they left the village. One baby was dangerous enough. Two was asking for a broken seal. The attack on them was the last straw. I didn’t see the sealing of the first half of the kyuubi into Arashi. Only Naruto’s sealing. So Naruto was kept within the village and Arashi taken to an orphanage to a town close by. Kakashi, if questioned you were responsible for checking on the boy since you were in and out of Konoha the most. You were sworn to secrecy about Arashi’s heritage and link to Naruto.”</span> </p><p> <span>The Hokage looked at his shinobi. “Understood?”</span> </p><p> <span>“Hai, Hokage-sama!” ANBU, Sennin, Jounin, and Genin responded alike.</span> </p><p> <span>“Good. Boys, anything we should prepare for?”</span> </p><p> <span>“When the wave mission comes up, give it to team seven.” Naruto stated bluntly. “It’s falsely labeled but we can handle it.”</span> </p><p> <span>“As long as Kakashi sensei trains with his sharingan so he doesn’t faint again.” Arashi smiled innocently even if it was a more reprimanding look. Making him look like his father for a moment.</span> </p><p> <span>The Hatake twitched and wilted a bit. “Harsh. Harsh as sensei was.” he murmured, but was ignored.</span> </p><p> <span>Hiruzen nodded. “Anything else? You will be busy with missions and training. We will not get to talk like this for a while.”</span> </p><p> <span>Arashi and Naruto shared looks. “Orochimaru is the Kage of Sound. He kills the Kazekage and manipulates Sand to joining Sound in an invasion during the Chuunin exams. You and Sasuke were the targets. Sasuke because he was the last Uchiha.” </span> </p><p> <span>“He still might target Sasuke since itachi is too strong.” Naruto hummed.</span> </p><p> <span>“He’s out to kill you Jiji….please….please take precautions. I….we can’t lose anymore precious people. We’re stronger than we were as Genins the first time, but we still have a long way to go.”</span> </p><p> <span>“I will not live forever my boy. And i’d rather die defending my village and taking my errant student with me than sacrifice someone else.”</span> </p><p> <span>Arashi and Naruto wilted. “We figured you’d say that.” The blonde muttered while the redhead’s gaze didn’t leave the floor.</span> </p><p> <span>Kakashi absently marveled at the boys. With the knowledge that they used to be one, he...he could see it. Arashi was the mature one, the one that learned to accept what he couldn’t control, even if he didn’t like it. Naruto was his innocence. The one that still wore a happy mask to hide his pain.</span> </p><p> <span>“You’re gonna make Kon cry again jiji.” Naruto whispered.</span> </p><p> <span>“Life and Death are a lesson everyone learns at least once in their life. If my life is the price that needs to be paid to protect my village, you already know i’ll pay it.”</span> </p><p> <span>Naruto still didn’t look up. Arashi bumped him and their twin eyes met. Kakashi wondered if they were talking via the telepathic bond the blonde had mentioned messing with.</span> </p><p> <span>“Fine jiji. We don’t like it, but that means you need to make sure everything is ready for when we bring Tsunade-baa-chan back.” Naruto stated firmly, even if his eyes were more watery than normal.</span> </p><p> <span>“Don’t get me wrong Naruto, I do not want to die. I’m not just going to stand still and let my own student kill me.”</span> </p><p> <span>Arashi huffed. “We know Jiji. You better get back in shape then. Sitting behind that desk all day probably hasn’t done you any favors. Heck even Tou-san figured out the paperwork trick. Hell, I did. Probably any jounin too lazy to do it themselves knows it.”</span> </p><p> <span>The Hokage stared and looked up to the Shinobi around him. “What trick?”</span> </p><p> <span>Jiraiya looked at his sensei surprised. “Seriously? We thought you knew.”</span> </p><p> <span>“Kage Bushin, Sir.” Kakashi hummed.</span> </p><p> <span>KI began to fill the room. ANBU and shinobi young and old </span> <em> <span>fled for their lives.</span> </em> </p><p> <span>~</span> </p><p> <span>Naruto and Arashi landed on the roof in a shunshin. A jutsu they hadn’t told anyone they knew.</span> </p><p> <span>“We at least told him in a nice way.” Naruto shrugged.</span> </p><p> <span>“Instead of making it into a public prank?” Arashi shot back and the Uzumaki grinned.</span> </p><p> <span>“Yep!”</span> </p><p> <span>They both paused when Kakashi appeared beside them. “We need to talk.” Hand on both their shoulders, he took the boys to his apartment.</span> </p><p> <span>Gently shoving them back onto his couch, kakashi took a chair after activating his own privacy seals. “Spill.”</span> </p><p> <span>“No.” They answered in unison.</span> </p><p> <span>“Why?”</span> </p><p> <span>“Jiraiya is the only one that knows entirely.” Arashi stated. </span> </p><p> <span>“Other than us.” Naruto shrugged.</span> </p><p> <span>“It will stay that way.”</span> </p><p> <span>“The more people that know-”</span> </p><p> <span>“-the more that those people will cause unknowing ripples.”</span> </p><p> <span>“There is already enough we can’t predict.”</span> </p><p> <span>“We will not be adding onto that.”</span> </p><p> <span>Kakashi stared at the two boys that still felt like two separate people until they did this sort of trick. Finishing each other’s sentences or thoughts.</span> </p><p> <span>“That….was very creepy.”</span> </p><p> <span>“We’re thinking of bringing out in public after training with Jiraiya.” Naruto beamed. “We figure it’s a good prank and proof that we grew closer and were told the truth of our parentage while we were gone.”</span> </p><p> <span>Kakashi sighed. “How….how close were we?”</span> </p><p> <span>Arashi and Naruto shared a look. “We know the fates of each Team Minato member and how they came to be and briefly when they occurred.” Arashi stated slowly.</span> </p><p> <span>Kakashi’s head dropped. “Of course you do.” he rubbed his face. “How...how am I supposed to train you two?”</span> </p><p> <span>“Give us excuses for the jutsu we know.” Naruto snorted. “Simple as that.”</span> </p><p> <span>“The Konoha twelve need to be stronger Kakashi-sensei.” Arashi said softly. A coal eye met earnest blues. “Help us in making them stronger. Don’t just favor one student over another. Train us all. Not just in jutsu but in body as well.”</span> </p><p> <span>“Then Cross train with the other teams!” Naruto exclaimed. “Let them watch as we kick their ass even with our shotty teamwork. It will annoy them enough to work harder if they see their competition’s strength.”</span> </p><p> <span>“Prepare us for war Kakashi-sensei.” arashi’s voice turned low and firm. Sounding entirely too much like his father for Kakashi’s sanity. “Our Minds came back, but as soon as we gave up our chakra and body for that of our baby counterpart’s? We started back at the beginning.”</span> </p><p> <span>“We’ve been practicing chakra control since we could walk.” Naruto pouted. “It’s still pretty bad, but better than it once was at this age.”</span> </p><p> <span>“War training.” Kakashi sighed and slowly straightened up. “I...I can do that.”</span> </p><p> <span>“Sakura ended up better than Ba-chan.” Naruto’s voice turned wistful. “I miss that version of her. Scary strong, but she’d finally grew into herself.”</span> </p><p> <span>“It’d be best to set her on the medic path early. So her strength, stamina, and taijutsu needs to be engraved into her so she’s ahead of the game when Tsunade-ba-chan gets her hands on her.”</span> </p><p> <span>“Sasuke has Itachi this time, and you, so you both can work on training him in genjutsu and his Raiton affinity. Not to mention he’d taken a liking to the katana while….away.” Naruto hedged. </span> </p><p> <span>Kakashi just stared. “Defected?”</span> </p><p> <span>“Sorta? Brainwashed by Orochimaru with a seal and promise of power to kill itachi.”</span> </p><p> <span>Kakashi winced. “Hell….”</span> </p><p> <span>“Yep.” The twins popped the word that basically described their future. Kakashi caught onto that and sighed again. To quote his Jounin Commander.</span> </p><p> <em> <span>Troublesome.</span> </em> </p> </div> <!--/main--> </div> <!-- end of cache --> </div> <!--afterword--> <div class="afterword preface group" role="complementary"> <!--series links, backwards and forwards--> <div id="series" class="series module"> <h3 class="heading">Series this work belongs to:</h3> <ul> <li><span class="series"><a class="previous" href="/works/35311747">← Previous Work</a><span class="divider"> </span><span class="position">Part 3 of the <a href="/series/2628928">Drabbles and Mini Works</a> series</span><span class="divider"> </span><a class="next" href="/works/36426217">Next Work →</a></span></li> </ul> </div> <!--/series links--> </div> <!--/afterword--> </div> <!-- END work skin --> </div> <!-- END work --> <!-- BEGIN comment section --> <!-- Gets embedded anywhere we need to list comments on a top-level commentable.
