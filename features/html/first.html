They were unsuccessful. It was not a usual sight, boys pushing trolleys laden with old-fashioned looking trunks and cages containing a large toad and a snowy owl.</P><P>"There is no need to rush," the auburn haired woman with them scolded. "You have plenty of time before the train leaves!"</P><P>"Mum!" the darker haired of the two boys turned around and whined, yet another unusual instance though only for the three of them. He wanted to get to the train and get a compartment as quickly as possible. The sooner they got on the train, the sooner it would leave, and the sooner they would be at Hogwarts. He was only barely able to contain his excitement, which truly said something about the level of emotion. This boy had learned a strict control over his feelings long ago.</P><P>Lily Potter sighed and a family with bright red hair rushed by them.</P><P>"Packed with muggles...,"</P><P>Harry Potter watched the family go by and saw that there was a boy his age among them. Judging by their hair color, they were Weasleys. No one else had hair that red and so many freckles. Harry had met their father more than once at the Ministry, and the oldest boy had come to the Manor a few times, but none of the others.</P><P>Neville used the time that they paused to take Trevor out of his cage and try to wrestle him into his pocket. The toad did not want to stay still though. Harry raised his eyebrows and smiled in amusement at Neville's attempts to control his pet and Neville frowned.</P><P>"He doesn't like being in his cage!" Neville asserted.</P><P>Harry almost laughed, but just lifted his eyebrows, "He doesn't like being in your pocket either!"</P><P>"The train, boys?" Lily Potter reminded them with a smile.</P><P>Harry gave his mother a sheepish grin and pushed his trolley forwards again. His Uncle Remus was supposed to have taken him and Neville to the train that morning but he was sick. That left Neville's grandmother watching Harry's brothers and sisters while Neville's parents and Harry's dad and Uncle Sirius were on duty at the Ministry. Harry's mum was the only one available to deliver them to the Hogwarts Express for their first year at Hogwarts.</P><P>They got to the barrier between platforms nine and ten and had to wait for the redheads to go through. Harry and Neville followed and headed for the back of the train. Uncle Sirius had advised them that it was the best place to sit. Actually, Uncle Sirius had advised them in many things Hogwarts related, most of which Harry's mother would hex the dog animagus for if she ever found out.</P><P>"You behave," Harry's mum admonished. "I don't want to get a single owl from your Head of House... and the same goes for you Neville."</P><P>Harry and Neville had been raised practically as brothers. They lived in villages close enough to walk between, though it was a long walk, and Harry's mum always watched Neville while Neville's parents were at work. They were both tutored by Uncle Remus, and separately by Uncle Sirius, Frank, Alice, and Harry's mum and dad.</P><P>Uncle Remus tutored Harry's siblings as well, Neville was an only child, and both Uncle Remus and his mum gave Harry private lessons for as long as he could remember in controlling his magic. It had a tendency to get loose when he was particularly excited, thus the need for iron control over his emotions.</P><P>Both boys tried to squirm away as Lily Potter gave them each a hug and kiss goodbye. They wrestled their trunks onto the train together, with the aid of the redheaded twins, and saw Harry's mum strike up a conversation with the twins' mum.</P><P>"Fred and George Weasley," one of the twins pronounced and bowed deeply with a flourish, "at your service."</P><P>"Neville Longbottom," Neville shook their hands while Harry found a place for his owl's cage. He had named her Hedwig, a name he had always liked from his history lessons. After the trip to Diagon Alley with Hagrid and Neville, Harry was <I>not</I> looking forward to meeting people.</P><P>"Harry Potter," Harry sighed and shook their hands as well.</P><P>Identical eyes widened and looked instantly at his forehead, "Blimey!"</P><P>"Are you really?" the other twin asked eagerly.</P><P>"We gotta go," the first twin said, eyes still wide in awe. "Lee Jordan's got a tarantula up front."</P><P>"See ya around Harry!" After a moment they remembered there was another boy there, "Neville."</P><P>Harry sat down and frowned. More than anything he wanted to go to Hogwarts, but he hated all the attention he got whenever he went out in public. Because of it he and his siblings had only been to Diagon Alley a handful of times, and usually with something of a disguise for Harry. They spent much more time in muggle places than magical ones, apart from the Manor. The muggle world was such an easy place to be anonymous, and Harry wasn't famous there.</P><P>When he went for his school supplies though, there had been too much confusion at home to get something together. His mother and his siblings had whatever cold it was that Uncle Remus now had and there wasn't a bathroom available for use in the Manor.</P><P>"You'll get used to it," Neville said sympathetically, and grabbed after Trevor, who had leapt out of his pocket, "and so will they."</P><P>Harry's hand moved almost without thought and plucked Trevor out of the air, "Just keep him in his cage until we get there Neville or we'll be chasing him all over the train."</P><P>Neville sighed, "I suppose. He just hates it in there!"</P><P>Their door flung open and one of the redheaded children entered, "Can I sit here? Everywhere else is full."</P><P>Harry shrugged almost imperceptibly and Neville nodded. The redhead dragged his trunk and the two other boys helped him put it on the overhead rack. He also had a cage with a rat. Harry narrowed his eyes. He did not like rats, not at all.</P><P>"How long have you had the rat?" he asked, a bit suspicious.</P><P>Peter Pettigrew had never been found. Harry had heard his parents speculating with Moony and Padfoot, as Uncle Remus and Sirius were often referred to, that Peter was probably hiding somewhere as a rat. Uncle Sirius had made it his life's mission to find Peter and Harry had privately vowed do whatever he could on his part to help his godfather. This rat had all its toes, but Harry had no idea what dark magic Pettigrew knew.</P><P>"He used to belong to my brother Percy," the boy said uneasily under Harry's gaze. "I'm Ron, Ron Weasley. Percy had another rat that ran away ages ago, so Mum and Dad bought this one for him."</P><P>Neville nudged Harry and apologized to Ron, "Sorry, he doesn't like rats."</P><P>"Sorry," Harry muttered, but his good mood was already gone.</P><P>"Are you really...?" Ron asked in a hushed tone.</P><P>Harry sighed and brushed aside his fringe. He knew he should have expected this, but he had been so excited about getting to Hogwarts that he hadn't given much thought for what would happen once he met the rest of the students.</P><P>"Wow," Ron settled down on a seat opposite them. "I thought Fred and George were teasing. They do that a lot."</P><P>The conversation soon turned towards quidditch, for which Harry was grateful. Ron redeemed himself slightly by arguing with Harry that the Chudley Cannons were the best professional team. Harry favored the Kenmore Kestrels, a team that actually won some of its games.</P><P>The door opened again and Harry was instantly on guard. A small blond boy was flanked by two larger boys, obviously serving the role of bodyguards to some degree. Harry's hand automatically rested on his hip holster, ready to pull his wand if there was trouble.</P><P>"I heard Harry Potter was in this compartment," the blond boy said with a superior tone. "So it's you then?"</P><P><I>"I really don't think they should let the other sort in..."</I></P><P><I>Neville was next door with Hagrid, so Harry was in the robe shop alone. He had almost pulled his brand new wand on the spot. His mother was muggle-born. Luckily for them both, Madame Malkin had finished with the blond and he left the shop before Harry could hex him.</I></P><P>"That's right," Harry responded.</P><P>"The name's Malfoy, Draco Malfoy," the blond said smugly.</P><P>Ron Weasley snickered, but Harry restrained himself. After all, his godfather was named Sirius and had a cousin named Andromeda who named her daughter Nymphadora... and Sirius was a Black, from one of the darkest families out there. Wizards and witches sometimes came up with the oddest names for their children.</P><P>"Think my name is funny, do you? There's no need to ask your name," Malfoy sneered defensively, and Harry didn't really blame him. "Red hair, freckles, hand-me-down robes, you're a Weasley." Malfoy turned to Harry again. "You don't want to go making friends with the wrong sort. I can help you there."</P><P>Harry just raised an eyebrow and saw that Neville was fighting hard to hold in his laughter. <I>Just who does this brat think he is?</I> Harry knew what his father said about Lucius Malfoy, though. "I think I can figure out who the <I>wrong sort</I> are for myself."</P><P>It might have escalated, but Trevor chose that moment to leap out of Neville's pocket again and landed right on Malfoy's face. The blond squealed and slapped at the toad, who had already leaped off. Harry shut the door quickly and snatched Trevor from the luggage rack, handing him back to Neville.</P><P>"Good old Trevor," Neville said fondly as he and Ron dissolved into laughter. Harry just smiled.</P><P>The only other disruption during the trip was from a bushy haired girl who told them they should be getting their robes on, as they were getting close to the school.</P><P>"How would she know?" Neville asked the others. "She's only a first year too."</P><P>Harry shook his head, but pulled on his robes anyway. It wasn't long before the train slowed to a halt and the first years were scrambling into boats for trips across the lake.</P><P>"My brothers told me we have to wrestle a troll," Ron said in a hushed voice.</P><P>The bushy haired girl, who had gotten into the boat with them, huffed and Harry and Neville exchanged a glance. Uncle Remus had told them what really happened at the sorting after Uncle Sirius had made them both stay awake in nervous anxiety two nights running with his tales of the trials they had to go through for their sorting, but had made them promise not to ruin the surprise for any other first years.</P><P>Professor McGonagall, who Harry's mother said was a wonderful teacher, was waiting for the first years and gathered them together outside of the great hall for her beginning of the year speech. Harry only half listened. From the stories his father and uncles told, Harry and Neville probably knew more about Hogwarts than anyone else there.</P><P>Harry already knew the locations of several secret passages and the general layout of the castle. The three remaining Marauders had recreated what they could of their Map from memory and Harry had promised to keep an eye out for the original.</P><P>They all trekked into the hall for the sorting and Harry stared up at the ceiling. No description could do it justice, he decided. He knew he had been to Hogwarts before, twice before he was three years old, but he didn't remember either trip.</P><P>The first was after he and his parents had been attacked by Voldemort and the second was the day that Neville's home was attacked by Death Eaters. Neville's grandmother had nearly died protecting him. It was also the day that his mother discovered she had been over two months pregnant when Voldemort attacked them all at Godric's Hollow.</P><P>The sorting hat was sitting on a stool, looking pretty ragged, when it opened its mouth and sang. Remus had told them that the song was different every year, and that occasionally the hat would have some good advice for the school, but that year it seemed to be a basic song about the four different houses.</P><P>Harry only half paid attention to the sorting, until names he knew were called. The bushy haired girl, Hermione Granger he discovered, was sorted into Gryffindor. He heard Ron Weasley groan next to him and shook his head. They didn't know if she was <I>that</I> bad. Neville was also sorted into Gryffindor and Harry clapped for him.</P><P>Neville had spent the night before at the Manor and had told Harry late at night that he was afraid he'd be sorted into Hufflepuff. The Longbottoms had been almost convinced Neville was a squib, and done all sorts of ridiculous stuff to try and scare the magic into showing in him. It finally had, but Neville still tended to be a little jumpy, especially if someone sneaked up on him. Harry suspected that both were also related to the Cruciatus Curse having been cast on Neville when Longbottom Hall was attacked.</P><P>"Potter, Harry," Professor McGonagall announced.</P><P>There was whispering and pointing all over the hall as Harry sat himself on the stool and the hat was lowered onto his head.</P><P><I>Hm, hm, very interesting indeed, another Potter. There's talent in there, oh my yes quite a bit of talent, and control like I've never seen. There is bravery and determination, loyalty, and the smarts of your mother, ambition of sorts and potential for great power. Well Mr. Potter I know exactly what to do with you. I'm not giving another Potter the chance to argue with me. You're going exactly where I told your father and grandfather they should be...</I></P><P>"Slytherin!"</P><P>If Harry had been eating, he would have choked. If he had been standing he would have needed to sit down immediately. As it was, he just felt a pit forming in his stomach. His insides went cold, and then it was like everything else did as well, though he knew his face showed none of his reaction. There wasn't a sound in the hall as everyone stared at him. There was no clapping for him as there had been for each other first year.</P><P>It was so cold...</P><P>Harry almost winced, but couldn't let it show. He reigned himself in, got a hold of his magic. He hadn't lost control like that in so long.</P><P>Then clapping started. Harry's eyes almost watered when he saw it was Neville, standing up at the Gryffindor table with a wide grin and applauding loudly. Harry smiled back at him involuntarily and looked over to the Slytherin table with a little apprehension. He saw the looks on their faces and knew exactly what they were thinking... they were not about to be outdone by a Gryffindor, and a first year at that. They stood almost as one and started clapping for Harry.</P><P>He slid off the stool and made his way over to the table. There were several open seats, and he chose the one furthest from Draco Malfoy. Most of the older students gave him nods and tight smiles.</P><P>"Tracey Davis," the girl he sat next to introduced herself.</P><P>Harry smiled politely, though he still felt like he had swallowed an icy boulder, "I suppose it's really unnecessary to tell you my name."</P><P>She laughed and they turned their attention back to the sorting, but not before Harry saw the glare sent his way by Malfoy. The last student to be sorted, Blaise Zabini, took a seat next to Harry. There was quite a bit of noise at the other tables, and Harry found he was actually glad to be sitting where he was. No one harassed him about his scar, or asked him questions about Voldemort. All of them knew the stories already, as there wouldn't be a single muggle-born at that table.</P><P>He looked up at the staff table and saw a sallow faced, dark haired man giving him a piercing stare. It made Harry decidedly uncomfortable and he shifted in his seat. It wasn't nearly as bad as what he felt when he looked at the professors next to the man, Quirrell and a witch with a vacant expression. Harry met Quirrell in Diagon Alley with Neville and Hagrid, and the Defense Against the Dark Arts professor was a little strange. There was a twinge in his scar, and he felt a headache begin to spread out from it.</P><P>"What's wrong?" Blaise Zabini was giving him a funny look.</P><P>Harry realized his hand had flown up to his scar. He rubbed his forehead, "Headache. Do you know who that professor is, next to Professor Quirrell?"</P><P>"That's Professor Snape," one of the older students said from a few seats down. "He's our Head of House and Potions Master."</P><P>Harry felt his eyes widen. He knew exactly who Severus Snape was, "I am so dead. Someone just <I>Avada</I> me now."</P><P>Eyebrows raised all around him. Tracey was the one who asked, though, "Why?"</P><P>"My dad and his friends used to play pranks on Professor Snape constantly when they were all students." Harry felt like banging his head on the table. His headache was just getting worse and worse. "If my godfather doesn't kill me for being sorted into Slytherin, Snape certainly will."</P><P>"It can't be all that bad," a boy that Harry thought was called Nott said disdainfully.</P><P>Over at the Gryffindor table there were screams and everyone looked to see the Gryffindor House ghost with his head hanging at his shoulder. Someone must have asked Nearly Headless Nick to elaborate on that name. Ask a stupid question...</P><P>Harry gave the boy a very level look and said plainly, "My godfather is Sirius Black."</P><P>"Oh," Nott responded.</P><P>No more was necessary. The entire wizarding world knew all about Sirius Black, the famous Auror, the innocent man who had spent a whole year in Azkaban without a trial. That alone had been enough to take away any chance of ever becoming Minister from Bartemius Crouch, whose son had then been captured in the attack against the Longbottoms. The sentencing of his son to life in Azkaban only further destroyed his career.</P><P>Sirius, who never shied from attention, had become the Ministry's poster-wizard for the side of light. His story, the child from the infamously dark Black family who got sorted into Gryffindor and became an Auror was published in the <I>Daily Prophet</I>, broadcast on the Wizarding Wireless Network, and even made into a children's book. He also appeared regularly in <I>Witch Weekly</I>, something the vain Auror's ego certainly didn't need.</P><P>"Want some help planning your funeral?" Tracey asked him wryly.</P><P>Harry definitely saw potential in that girl. She had a decent sense of humor. He finally cracked a smirk, "Yeah. Should we decorate in red and gold?"</P><P>Someone across from them almost choked on their pumpkin juice. She grinned at them, "Oh no. I couldn't see you in red and gold. Green goes so much better with your coloring."</P><P>"Hm, I wonder why...," Harry feigned ignorance. The Slytherin House ghost took that moment to make his appearance, and Harry was pleased to see that the ghost spent the whole feast next to a very uncomfortable looking Draco Malfoy.</P><P>Every detail for Harry's anticipated demise was laid out by the time the meal ended. The first year students were led to the Slytherin common room by a fifth year prefect named Montague, who told them all that he was on the quidditch team.</P><P>He gave them a lecture about Slytherin House, how they should never get caught disobeying the rules, and any problems between housemates should be solved in-house. The sixth year students who would be their 'substitute big brothers and sisters' would seek them out sometime the next day. There was to be no public dissention. He gave them the password to the common room <I>'Acetylsalicylic Acid'</I>.</P><P>At the strange looks he got the prefect shrugged, "Professor Snape said something about keeping a fine balance in the universe."</P><P>Whoever had decided which students were sleeping in which beds had not been thinking along the same line. Harry's bed was right next to Malfoy's, which was against the wall. One of the oafs, Crabbe Harry thought, was one his other side. Blaise Zabini, Theodore Nott, and the other oaf were across from them.</P><P>The boys all gave each other uneasy looks as they prepared for bed. Harry and Malfoy both instantly cast a series of protective spells around their beds and belongings. Harry couldn't help but be impressed at Malfoy's knowledge, but he still didn't like him.</P><P>As he fell asleep Harry reminded himself to send a note to his parents about his sorting, and another to Remus begging him to restrain Sirius when he found out. He had also promised his sister Brianna, or Brie as he called her, that he would write, and make sure to include a note for Alex and Ian, who were just learning to read and write.</P><p style="text-align:center;"><B>.:</B>O<B>:.:</B>O<B>:.:</B>O<B>:.:</B>O<B>:.:</B>O<B>:.:</B>O<B>:.:</B>O<B>:.:</B>O<B>:.:</B>O<B>:.:</B>O<B>:.:</B>O<B>:.:</B>O<B>:.:</B>O<B>:.:</B>O<B>:.:</B>O<B>:.:</B>O<B>:.:</B>O<B>:.:</B>O<B>:.</B></P><P>Please Review!</P><P><B>.:</B>O<B>:.:</B>O<B>:.</B></P><P>reposted: 8/28/08</P><!-- end story -->
