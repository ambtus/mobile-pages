table with a notepad, pens, snacks and drinks. </p><p>"I don't know whether you believed me last night or not, but I, for my part, am willing to get back on track," John says and takes one of the small water cress sandwiches Stiles has put together. "First order of the day: our food." </p><p>Stiles gapes at him. "You want to talk about food? Voluntarily?" </p><p>"Yes, I do." </p><p>"But why now? Shouldn't we talk about shooting lessons and stuff?" </p><p>"We will do that later. This is not about Argent or the werewolves, it's about us. I realize that you want me to eat healthy things because you don't want me to die." </p><p>Stiles flushes and looks down at the spirals he's drawn onto the notepad. "You do eat a lot of crap." </p><p>"As the scale keeps telling me. And my doctor. And Melissa." John clears his throat. "The point is, you're right and I want you to feel safe. If you feeling safe means that I change my diet, so be it. Compared to everything else, it's the easiest thing to do, so we'll start here. But if I do this, I'm not doing it alone." </p><p>Stiles looks up so fast that he feels a little dizzy. "Really?" </p><p>"Really. I'm ready to go all out, throw out the crap, buy the good stuff, look up recipes on the internet and get clever about nutrition. The whole deal." </p><p>"Oh my god, okay." Stiles flushes again, this time in anticipation. "Did you know that eating a whole foods, plant-based diet is really good for the arteries? We could totally do that, maybe have meat a couple of times during the week, and we should buy a juicer and a blender, do green smoothies and all that jazz. I read everything about it and even tried the food in that new vegan place. You'll love it. I could take lessons and I'd do all the meal-plannig, cooking and shopping." </p><p>"Sounds exciting, but I want to help. If we both do that, I want to know what the big deal is." </p><p>Stiles can't quite believe his ears and so he jumps up and grabs a huge trash bag. "Can we start now?" </p><p>"Sure. 's not like I have to go to the station today." John takes his own trash bag and joins Stiles at the cupboard. "What should I throw out?" </p><p>"Everything in a box," Stiles replies, chucking an unopened box of pop tarts, followed by sugary cereal. "White flour, sugar, cake, chips ... we're breaking up with them." </p><p>John takes a deep breath, reaches for his snacks and does what has to be done. </p><p>After the cupboards they clean out the fridge and the freezer, leaving both nearly empty, and regroup in front of Stiles' laptop to check out staples for a plant-based diet. </p><p>"I'd never take meat away from you," Stiles says, scribbling down legumes and root vegetables, "but it's not really good for us. I'll show you studies later, if you want. For taste it's okay sometimes, though. Same with cheese." </p><p>"I get that, but do we really have to cut out wheat? What are we going to eat?" </p><p>Stiles snickers. He orders Google to show him the wonders of vegetarian dishes. "Behold the food porn, dad. We can eat all of that, promise. And it's really as good as it looks. Anyway, it's noon already, we should go shopping." </p><p>"What are we going to eat?" John asks again, sounding decidedly forlorn. </p><p>"I thought we could make wraps. We can buy everything we need at the mall. I've, uh, looked into it for a while, but with everything going on and no money to buy stuff because I had to keep replacing car parts and slashed up clothes and, uh, okay, you're looking kind of murderous right now, pops?" </p><p>"Wraps," John says firmly and schools his murderous face into something calmer. "But before we go shopping I want you to give your statement at the station. I want to get Argent legally and since you can name witnesses, we should exploit that. I won't let him stay at your school if I can help it. The parents have to know what a SOB he is." </p><p>Stiles sighs quietly. "Okay. I-I don't like it, but I get it." He feels his expression slip as something close to disappointment squeezes his stomach. "It's not as if Scott or anyone else with superpowers came to the rescue." </p><p>"I'll have words with them about that," John agrees, "but honestly? You shouldn't depend on them for that, son. Your mom and I always believed in the saying that you're responsible for your own health and happiness. When she got sick we didn't just trust her doctors. We looked into everything that promised relief or even a cure." </p><p>"I remember that," Stiles says and smiles feebly. "You always asked me to read magazines and stuff and holler when something about dementia came up." </p><p>"You were a big help," his dad replies mistily. "We tried everything, and I mean <i>everything</i>, we could to make her better. When that failed, we could let go with the knowledge that at least we didn't just let it happen. That we fought for our family." He scrubs his face and blinks. "What I'm trying to say is that we go down fighting, or not at all, you hear me? Just because we won't shoot Argent with arrows or electrocute him, we can still hit him where it hurts." </p><p>"We'll have to find him first, though." </p><p>"Oh, we will. Working with the law doesn't mean my fist doesn't have his name on it." </p><p>They first write out Stiles' statement and then compile a list of things to buy. After a calming glass of lemonade they leave the house together, shoulder to shoulder. The weather is unexpectedly nice for late April, sunny and warm. Stiles finds that it clashes with the horror of last night and he also feels strangely exposed. His bruises are for the world to see and he doesn't know how to deal with it. </p><p>"Don't you dare being ashamed," John admonishes on the way into the sheriff department building when Stiles makes himself as small and inconspicuous as possible. "You tried to help your friends and got roughed up for your trouble. If anything you should be proud that you stood up for someone else." </p><p>"Sheriff," Dana, the new receptionist, greets them, saving Stiles from having to answer. Her eyes linger on his unhappy face and she smiles sympathetically. "Hey, kiddo. I'll call Eileen so you can get this over with." </p><p>"Thanks. We'll go on through." John leads Stiles through the station and stops in front of an open door. </p><p>Stiles knows Eileen, of course he does, and he likes her. She's tall, heavy-set and has long, blond hair like a valkyrie. But despite her imposing looks she has a heart of gold. It's nearly impossible not to feel safe in her presence. It's a wonder she survived Matt Daehler's insane attack; many others weren't so lucky. All the new faces around the station make Stiles' stomach drop whenever he's here to visit his dad. </p><p>"Dear god, Stiles," she exclaims and gets up from her chair to hug him. "The pictures from last night only look half as bad as it is now. Sit down, I'll get you some water." While she pours, she turns her attention to the sheriff. "Did you talk about what happened?" </p><p>"He's here to give a full statement," John assures her. "We already typed it up for you but feel free to ask questions and make new photos." </p><p>Eileen takes her digital camera. "We should. Don't worry, I won't take long." </p><p>Still feeling uncomfortable, Stiles lets her take pictures and gets dressed again as quickly as the aches and pains in his body allow. </p><p>"I can't believe that Gerard Argent would do something like this," she mutters, loading the pictures onto her computer. "Don't they <i>screen</i> the people who apply for jobs at the school anymore?" </p><p>Stiles snorts loudly. "If that were the case, Harris wouldn't be around to abuse students." </p><p>"What do you mean?" </p><p>"Nothing, dad. He's just a giant prick who loves to give out detention for no reason." </p><p>"To everybody or just you?" </p><p>Stiles tenses at the clipped tone. If he didn't know better he'd guess that there's a story there, but he's not brave enough to ask for it right now. </p><p>"Sometimes Scott, too," he mumbles. </p><p>"That school," Eileen says ominously and makes a note on her writing pad. "No wonder there's vandalism going on." </p><p>She takes her time reading Stiles' statement and only asks a few questions regarding Gerard's possible motive. For practical reasons the Stilinskis decided to stick to the truth as much as they can and blamed everything on Gerard's hate for Allison's new boyfriend and friends. </p><p>"Well, the old man is clearly off his rocker," she says with a headshake. "Beating up kids because he doesn't want his granddaughter involved with them. Who even does this in this time and age?" </p><p>"You should've seen her mom, she was scary," Stiles says bitterly as he signs his statement. "She threatened Scott with castration. And meant it." </p><p>"That would be Victoria Argent, right?" She pulls up the file of Mrs. Argent's suicide, which had only happened around a week earlier. To Stiles, it seems more like a year. "Huh, she also worked at the school, what the hell? Seriously, we should have a word with the board, John. It's like a meeting place for psychos or something." </p><p>"I'll work on it," the sheriff says, voice steely. "But my son's my priority right now. I'll take a couple more days off but you can reach me anytime if something comes up." </p><p>"Good to hear." Eileen reaches out and squeezes Stiles' cold hand. "Enjoy your time together, and maybe you should think about taking self-defense classes. Not to beat someone up, but to feel better about your ability to protect yourself." When Stiles fidgets slightly, she turns and grabs a card from her table. "Here, this is the studio where I send the girls and boys who need to get out of bad home situations. It's two towns away so no one has to know you're going if you don't want to." </p><p>John accepts the card and they say their goodbyes. On the way to the mall, Stiles checks his phone and chews on his lower lip as he types listlessly. </p><p>"Is everything alright?" John asks at length. </p><p>"Yeah, it's just ..." Stiles frowns and fights against a wave of nausea. "Nobody tells me what went down before Lydia and I crashed the party, not even Scott. But I saw Derek and he looked like crap. Fuck." </p><p>"Have you contacted the others, or are you just waiting for them to pity you?" </p><p>"'course I have, and no. So far, only Derek answered." Stiles puts his phone away again and scowls. "I clearly need better friends." </p><p>His father hums quietly. "Is Hale okay?" </p><p>"He said yeah, but that's bullshit. <i>Nobody</i> is okay after this." </p><p>"Maybe <i>he</i> needs better friends as well," John says thoughtfully. "And a therapist, but I won't be the one to say that to his face." </p><p>"Ha, me neither." </p><p>They pull onto the parking lot of the mall and make an effort to push the matter back while they shop for groceries. Stiles gets to buy half of the produce section and selects lots of healthy dry goods that have his father pouting. It helps to ignore the inquisitive stares from other shoppers and the dull aches in his body. </p><p>Once they're finished with their trip, Stiles sets out to prepare lunch. John retreats to his office and places a few calls. He comes back when the smell of fresh falafel permeates the house and Stiles makes a show of spreading hummus, salad, sundried tomatoes, cucumber and falafel onto a large wrap. He fixes the first for his father and the second for himself and they eat in blissful silence right at the kitchen table, which almost never happens because John usually works on cases there. </p><p>"I gotta say that this is a surprise," John admits after the last bite. "I wouldn't mind eating that more often." </p><p>"Great, because I remember you telling me I could go wild on Amazon," Stiles grins and then grimaces because his split lip hurts. "Not for cookbooks though, we can get recipes for free on the internet, but we need a good kitchen machine and stuff. If that's still okay, I mean." </p><p>"Son, I just threw out all my food and let you buy a ton of vegetables. We're going through with it. Get your laptop before I regret saying anything." </p><p>"Yay!" </p><p>Just a short while later, both sit next to each other and compare juicers. After choosing one, they decide on a Kitchen Aid for their smoothies and even look into cast iron pots and pans for their cooking because their current cooking ware is outdated and a little worse for wear. </p><p>"Sorry that it's so expensive," Stiles says, gulping at the total. </p><p>John shrugs. "You can pay me back by finding out what exactly happened last night." </p><p>"Will do, daddy-o. Maybe Scott will finally take a damn call." </p><p>"Not so fast. I want you to get the story from Hale first. Scott's a good kid, but if he hasn't contacted you yet, you should concentrate on the people who're more willing to talk. Might be interesting." </p><p>"Willing my arse," Stiles groans. "But challenge accepted. I'll call him after cleaning up." </p><p>John helps and promptly bitches about their lack of a dishwasher, which is hilarious after so many years of Stiles wanting to get one. After doing the dishes, they are back on Amazon and put one into the basket. </p><p>"Seriously?" Stiles asks. "You're doing dishes <i>once</i> and decide that you don't want to anymore?" </p><p>"Shut up, I'm an adult and can buy a dishwasher if I want." </p><p>"Sure, pops." </p><p>"For that, I'll choose the meanest fact-a-day calendars they have." </p><p>John takes control of the mouse and selects several calendars, ranging from history, biology, geography, sports and, most interestingly for Stiles, brain puzzlers. Then they both look over the many, many intelligence training books and card games that are on offer and pick out more than they can hope to ever work through. At last, several cheap stopwatches find their way into the cart. </p><p>Finally at the check-out, Stiles refuses to acknowledge the amount of money their shopping spree will cost. His dad even splurges on superfast shipping. </p><p>"Okay, my head is officially spinning," Stiles says and carefully looks his father over. "Why do we need all this?" </p><p>"According to your econ teacher, Finstock, you're super smart. I want to make you even smarter." John smirks. "Or are you too chicken to engage in a friendly bit of competition?" </p><p>Gaping, Stiles flounders for words. "Never!" he exclaims. "Is that what the stopwatches are for?" </p><p>"Yup. We place one next to each puzzle calendar and book and take our time. At the beginning of each week we hash out a reward and check our track record on Sunday. Looking up the solutions is a no-go, though. If you can't solve it, you give up and check it out after the week is done." </p><p>"No penalties?" </p><p>"Losing is penalty enough," John quips, and damn if he isn't right. Stiles hates losing, it's a trait he shares with both his parents. "Let's outline our daily regimen. We could tack it to the fridge." He jots down their brain jogging competition and the change in eating habits on a fresh page of their legal pad. "Do you want to add something?" </p><p>"Yeah, actually." Stiles rubs over his buzzed hair. "I, uh, I want to start taking self-defense classes. Eileen's right, I need to put this behind me. It's embarrassing enough that someone's grandpa beat me up once. I won't let it happen again." </p><p>His dad looks proud. "I'll call the studio. As soon as you feel up to it, you can go. Lacrosse might suffer for it, though." </p><p>"That's okay. I guess the warm-ups for self-defense are just as kick-ass as they are for lacrosse anyway. I thought about jogging in the mornings, too." Stiles flushes a little. "I also want to see if I can lower my dose of Adderall. I read the stuff up online and I don't ... it's poison. If I can, I don't want to take it anymore." </p><p>"We'll see about that," John says calmly. "Let's take care of our home life first, alright?" </p><p>"Yeah, of course. I can't stop cold turkey anyway, unless I want to drop dead or something." </p><p>His dad writes both points down in neat letters. "My next phys eval is coming up in the fall, I could run with you, if you want." </p><p>"Give me a week and I'm golden." </p><p>Because they both feel that they deserve a treat after so much planning and eating healthy, Stiles cuts up strawberries and serves them with dairy-free vanilla sauce. His dad likes it a lot and they both squander another half hour in front of the computer, trying to best each other at mind games. It's more fun than Stiles could have imagined - and harder than expected. While he's adept at collecting trivia on Wikipedia and Google, his father is clever on another level. He's thinking circles around his son and it makes Stiles eager to sink his teeth into the brain puzzlers and riddles to keep up. </p><p>It's John who's breaking up the party eventually. "I'll have to call the station and check in. Why don't you call Hale and see what he has to say about yesterday?" </p><p>"Sure," Stiles agrees. "I'll let you know if he spills." </p><p>"If he knows what's good for him, he will." </p><p>+++</p> </div> <!--/main--> <div class="chapter preface group"> <div class="end notes module" id="chapter_2_endnotes" role="complementary"> <h3 class="heading">Notes:</h3> <blockquote class="userstuff"> <p>Thank you so much for the warm welcome and your interest in my little story.
