I bet he comes in his suit," Clint smirks. "Let's not miss his grand entrance, eh? You," he stops a guard, "where will Iron Man touch down?"</p> <p>"Looks like it will be the roof, sir," the harried agent replies and then runs after his group.</p> <p>Coulson looks like he wants to facepalm, although he swallows his sigh and allows Steve to lead them upstairs.</p> <p>"So much for secret headquarters," Clint whispers loudly enough for everyone to hear.</p> <p>They climb several stairs at the end of which Stiles feels like he will heave out a lung if he has to walk one more step. All the others aren't even breathing hard and Stiles curses them quietly.</p> <p>At least Iron Man hasn't landed yet, which is a small consolation. The sea of armed agents and a furious looking Fury, however, are not reassuring at all.</p> <p>"There he comes," Clint says helpfully and points at a fast-moving, gleaming speck in the sky. "Drives flight security crazy when he takes the suit out to meet people."</p> <p>Stiles manages to swallow back his lung and takes a couple of deep breaths before straightening up. Tony is eating up miles like they're nothing and then he's already slowing down and descending, all elegance and brute force in a shiny red and gold package.</p> <p>Once he's touched down, the eerie, glowing eyes of the mask find Stiles and Tony's warped voice says, "Hey kid, thanks for the invite."</p> <p>“Stilinski!” Fury shouts and turns to Stiles. He clasps his hands behind his back and looms like the world's most intimidating drill instructor. "Is there anything you'd like to say for yourself before I kick your ass back to your hick town?"</p> <p>Put on the spot like that, Stiles' motor mouth takes over. It doesn't help that every single one of the fifty or so agents stares at him, eager to hear his response.</p> <p>"Uhm, yeah, see, it all began when Cap and Clint mutinied in the face of your shitty canteen food, and since we were hungry I may or may not have ordered some Indian - in self-defence, you see - because who doesn't love Indian." He gulps in some air, ignores Clint's scandalized squawk at being thrown under the bus and continues, "As to Iron Man being here ... I may have told him to come because he kind of hijacked my payment for the order and as a decent human being I couldn't let that stand, alright. Besides, I thought he could use a break, because <em>hello</em>, workaholic."</p> <p>Mutters break out among the agents, coupled with envious looks at their small group. </p> <p>"I see. A regular bleeding heart, just my fucking luck." Fury's tone is gravelly but, incredibly, tinged with a touch of perverse amusement. "One last question, Stilinski. Did you, by chance, tell Stark to come in his suit? Think before you fess up, your continued existence depends on it."</p> <p>"Excuse me, Fury, I'm not a circus pony performing for the unwashed masses," Tony snipes before Stiles can stutter out an answer. </p> <p>"Could have fooled me," Fury retorts unapologetically. He glares at both Tony and Stiles one last time and then bellows, "All right, people, the show is over! Get back to work! You have half an hour to submit requests for a new, improved food offer at HQ. Send them to Agent Coulson since you've apparently been whining to him anyway."</p> <p>A loud cheer erupts and the tense atmosphere vanishes beautifully like mist on a warm morning as gun safeties are clicked back on and the weapons go back into their holsters. Amidst laughter and excited talking the agents rapidly leave the roof top.</p> <p>"Now I see what happened with Pig Town," Tony says gleefully after opening his visor. His dark eyes are shining with mirth. "Congratulations, kid, you're a born trouble maker."</p> <p>"Tell me about it," Derek quips. "I can't take him anywhere."</p> <p>"But, but-" Stiles tries to defend himself.</p> <p>"Save it for someone who cares," Tony counters, waving his protest away. "I tried to eat here once, ask Coulson how that went. Anyway, seeing how we still have five minutes: do you want to have a look at HQ from above?"</p> <p>oOo</p> <p>After a short but thoroughly exhilariating flight in Iron Man's arms they descend on the food which the delivery boy has left at the decoy reception and watch the short movie Clint has made of the adventure with Stiles' smartphone. Stiles sends it to Lydia to distract her from Pepper’s no doubt wonderful tour of Stark Industry’s science department and is about to send it to his father as well when Derek speaks up.</p> <p>"You know that your father will have a stroke if he sees you up in the air like that, don't you?" the werewolf asks. "That suit isn't exactly passenger friendly."</p> <p>"Yeah, you looked like a damsel in distress," Clint snickers. “Even shrieked a little like one.” </p> <p>Stiles is too giddy to care. "It was a manly shout and it was awesome and nothing you can say will ruin it for me." He presses send and slides the phone back into his pocket. "There it goes, dad will deal."</p> <p>"That's my boy." Tony, who has stolen almost all of the samosas, smirks with satisfaction. "If you're good, I might let JARVIS put you in one of my older suits and take a little spin in my garage when you move back into the tower."</p> <p>Stiles can't believe his ears and nearly bursts with excitement, but then he sobers and lets his shoulders slump. "Uh, define good?"</p> <p>Clint roars with laughter while Derek buries his face in his hands.</p> <p>"I promised to keep him safe," he mumbles. "You were there, Steve. How am I supposed to do that if Stark is sabotaging me at every turn? The sheriff will kill me."</p> <p>"Don't be a drama queen, Hale." Tony swallows noisily. "I won't let him fly ... much, and I'll even disable the bigger weapons. Deal?"</p> <p>"He won't leave the garage and you'll disable <em>all</em> the weapons of the suit," Steve negotiates. "And I'll be there, in case something happens. Together, Derek and I might be able to keep it under control."</p> <p>"Fine, whatever." Obviously finished with this part of their conversation, Tony then turns his attention to Coulson. "Now, how does the search for Banner go? The lab is nearly ready and I have a dozen new drones who need some sprucing up."</p> <p>"Mr. Stark, Director Fury and I are still not sure that allowing you two to meet would be a good idea. Especially in New York, where a lot of people could be hurt if Dr. Banner had an ... episode."</p> <p>"It's a great idea, and you know it," Tony counters. "Kid, tell him so. I've got it all planned out." </p> <p>Stiles would like nothing better, but on this point he has to side with Coulson; everybody has seen the Hulk on TV and the destructive power he possesses. "What if he really wants to stay hidden? You know, so he won't hurt any more people?" he asks, just to make sure that Tony won't run roughshot over everybody in the name of science, least of all Bruce Banner, who seems to do his best not to be a bother to anyone.</p> <p>"Jeez, you're a boring lot, aren't you? I'd have expected more from you at least, kid." Tony seems genuinely miffed.</p> <p>"Yeah, not really, and you know it," Stiles retorts, unwilling to be emotionally manipulated. "We had trouble staying alive with one single deranged alpha werewolf in town. I really don't want to find out how much worse Dr. Banner will be if he flips his shit. Especially if he’s basically indestructible."</p> <p>"Succinctly put, Mr. Stilinski, thank you," Coulson says. "That is not to say that a cooperation wouldn't be beneficial, or that Dr. Banner doesn't deserve your offer. It's just that, right now, SHIELD does not have the means to contain a threat of this magnitude to the city. It might be better for everyone involved to acquire Dr. Banners agreement and goodwill <em>before</em> we proceed further."</p> <p>"Boring," Tony groans. </p> <p>Stiles knows he probably looks like a fanboy at Tony but he doesn't care. "Dude, if <em>you</em> offer Dr. Banner your help instead of dragging him here, he might listen. You could offer him a lab and a house in the wilderness and have video chats about work and stuff. You're rich, you could totally make it work. Also, if <em>you</em> ask, one science bro to another, he might even be cool with the SHIELD attachment, because let's face it, SHIELD will come knocking."</p> <p>The corner of Coulson's mouth curls up slightly and Clint outright says, "Yeah, that could work."</p> <p>"I'm shocked. How are you making so much sense, kid? And even more important, <em>why</em>?" Tony complains. "This was supposed to be an epic adventure: a first class trip to India, food poisoning from delicious, yet questionable street food, and a lot of sweeping Banner off his feet."</p> <p>"Of course it was," Derek says flatly. "But now that this is off the table, can you please try and recruit him like a normal, sane person?"</p> <p>"You could send him one of those e-mails," Steve says encouragingly. "With the attachment thingies to show him the lab in the wilderness. He'd like that, I'm sure."</p> <p>Disgruntled, Tony chews on his food. "I hate you."</p> <p>"There'll be enough opportunities to sweep Dr. Banner off his feet," Stiles consoles him and lightly bumps his shoulder against Tony's. "I mean, it's <em>you</em>. Who doesn't want to work with you? I don't think he'll be able to say no."</p> <p>Tony only huffs and reaches for the chana masala, but he can't quite hide the pleased look in his eyes.</p> <p>After lunch they see Tony off and finish their tour of the building. Stiles discovers a huge armory where experts also tinker with new weapon designs, then sees the hall where the utilities for agents in action are stored as well as the war rooms and at last the gym floor.</p> <p>"Physical fitness is a non-negotiable requirement for active field agents and takes up a good portion of their work day," Coulson explains as Stiles gapes at the dozens of agents warming up and sparring with partners. "It's a little different for analysts, but we encourage them to keep fit and up to date with their self-defense training. A certain minimal weapon competence is always required and has to be renewed every three months."</p> <p>"Yeah, we can't afford to lose our analysts to every little criminal on the streets, so you better pay attention," Clint says. "The lockers are this way, I've got gym clothes for you."</p> <p>Stiles, Derek, and Steve follow Clint and swiftly change into black sweats and T-shirts. After that, they leave the public area behind and enter a small gym hall. The doors sport huge locks, both manual and electronical. When Derek tells them that he can also hear the hum of some kind of machine, Clint admits that they have a couple of small EMF emitters running to prevent spies from filming or listening in on Steve and Derek.</p> <p>"And you," he tells Stiles and raises an eyebrow at his surprised expression. "We definitely don't want others to know what you can do with your mountain ash."</p> <p>"Oh. Right. So, what am I supposed to do while Sourwolf and Cap get their training in?"</p> <p>Clint rolls his shoulders. "First we're getting warmed up. Then I'll let you punch me for a while, and last I'll show you some mean tricks to get an attacker off your back. If you're still standing by then, I'll show you how to get one over your sourwolf."</p> <p>They start with a slow jog to give their bodies a chance to keep the food down. Derek and Steve are going increasingly faster as the number of laps increases, but Clint soon takes Stiles aside to a corner and finishes the warm-up with isometric excercises and a lot of deep stretches. After that he helps Stiles into gloves, dons protective gear and first shows and then encourages him to punch the pads on his hands with all that he has.</p> <p>This proves to be astoundingly therapeutic; once Stiles has begun, it is worryingly easy to beat out the toxic feelings about Scott and the situation in Beacon Hills. It all boils to the surface: Scott’s selfish behaviour, his callous treatment of Derek and, worst of all, his utter indifference to the fact that everybody but Isaac is not okay with how things went down.</p> <p>"And break," Clint calls when Stiles can barely see straight with all the sweat in his eyes. He lowers the pads. "Take ten, drink some water and watch the others." He then vanishes and leaves Stiles alone with his churning thoughts.</p> <p>Sipping his water, Stiles watches Steve teach Derek one grip or throw after the other. First he demonstrates on Derek, then guides the werewolf through the steps until he's secure enough to really put speed and power into the moves. The ensuing scuffles look brutal to Stiles, but both Derek and Steve always slow down after a few minutes and come back for more. Even now, after only a few sessions with Steve, Derek looks so much more competent, even kind of graceful.They invite Stiles to join them, but he's still winded and declines.</p> <p>"Martial arts are definitely the right call for Hale," Clint says, sitting down next to Stiles. "The Cap has taken a few Jeet Kune Do lessons but we'll have to find a trainer soon if Hale wants to continue, and he really should."</p> <p>Before them, Derek throws Steve off and jumps against the wall of the gym, somersaulting. He lands right behind Steve, grabs him around the chest and throws him with all his might against another wall. Steve manages to somewhat break his fall and not smash his skull and then they're in a clinch again, grappling and cursing and grinning. </p> <p>“I don’t get how people can live with getting beat up like that,” Stiles admits. “I mean, it looks way cool and is super useful, but you get like, you know, majorly beat up. Which is painful, even with super healing.” An especially hard swing sends Derek to the floor and causes blood to gush from his nose. “Ow, ouch!” He glances at Clint. “Does that make me a wimp?”</p> <p>Clint smiles crookedly. “No, just a normal human being. To be a fighter like that, a bit of masochism sure doesn’t hurt. But it’s more than that. It’s simply in some people’s genes. Some people are fighters, just like others are born helpers or con artists or perverts.” </p> <p>“That’s kind of deep.”</p> <p>“Naw, not really. In my profession you just learn to put people in categories, and fast. There are the obvious, with dozens of subcategories which often depend on the situation. Sussing them out in a split second <em>will</em> save your life sooner or later.”</p> <p>“You got an example?” Stiles prompts.</p> <p>“How about we turn it around and you tell me what you think of the Cap. Then, I'll tell you whether or not I agree,” Clint says. "And whether you'd be dead in case of emergency." </p> <p>“I shouldn’t. He can hear me,” Stiles replies, uncomfortable.</p> <p>“He won’t care,” Clint assures him. “Come on, give it a shot.”</p> <p>Letting his breath whistle through his teeth, Stiles takes a moment to gather his thoughts. “Well, Cap definitely has a strong moral code. As a non-criminal I definitely don’t feel threatened by him, even though he’s got these huge muscles and this ridiculous shoulder to waist ratio and could squash me like a bug if he wanted.”</p> <p>Clint chuckles.</p> <p>“But,” Stiles continues, “even though he vibes me as a generally super nice guy who hates firearms, he’s got this vigilante thing going on. I bet he makes mincemeat of the bad guys without batting an eye. And I peg him as someone to keep a bad guy from killing you, but to run off as soon as he knows you can hold your own. Or, in reverse, if I were a bad guy, I'd be shitting myself but not exactly fear for my life if I'm not a nazi or some other sort of murdering low-life. Also, I’d wager my jeep that he’s a really sassy son of a bi-”</p> <p>“Language, Stiles,” Steve calls casually. He and Derek end their fight and, after a hearty handshake, stroll over.</p> <p>“Language? Seriously?” Stiles snorts. “Anyway, how did I do?”</p> <p>“Not bad, but that wasn’t too hard,” Clint says. “I’ll find someone else for you to profile. Someone you don't know. We squishy humans have to be on top of our game in this environment.”</p> <p>It’s a lesson Stiles is looking forward to, though he wonders how far he’ll have to run in case Clint ever asks him to profile Fury. Even Coulson for all his bland agreeableness seems kind of like a dicey subject.</p> <p>“But for today it’s enough,” Steve says with a kind smile. “I watched you a little, you did really well.”</p> <p>Stiles blushes a little at the praise. “Thanks, though I’ll probably be unable to move tomorrow, and I didn’t even do the self-defence.”</p> <p>“It won’t be so bad with a good cool-down. C’mon, you too, Cap, Hale,” Clint says. He leads them through almost fifteen minutes of yoga stretches before allowing them a hot shower.</p> <p>“What will we do with our evening?” Stiles wonders once they’re dressed and ready to go. Suddenly the hours seem very vast, even though he’s exhausted. He misses his dad and Lydia fiercely.</p> <p>“Stark has sent a car,” Clint says after a look at his phone. “He thought that you’d feel homesick and proposed that you spend tonight and the next day with him and be sent back here tomorrow evening.”</p> <p>Stiles looks at Derek. “What do you think?”</p> <p>“I’ll come back tomorrow morning, if that’s okay,” the werewolf says, “but I think it’d be good for you to be with the others. Maybe you should even move back to the tower. You didn’t really sign up for nonstop training and I know that you want to spend more time with Tony and Pepper.”</p> <p>“But I don’t want to leave you here alone,” Stiles protests. “This having your back thing works both ways. You’re under my protection and SHIELD needs to know that. I mean,” he stutters, suddenly mortified at his presumption, “such as it is. Which, yeah, not much, but still.”</p> <p>“It will be fine, Stiles,” Steve interjects before Stiles can put his foot in his mouth in even further. “I promise. If Derek likes we can share rooms, and whenever he wants to go out to meet you, I’ll find a way to make it happen.”</p> <p>Stiles eyes them both for a moment, weighing his own desires against Derek’s need to learn something useful and be with someone who just <em>gets</em> him. Even if it means leaving him out of his sight and trusting someone else with his safety.</p> <p>Then he realizes that Derek is a grown-ass man who is allowed to make his own decisions and really doesn’t need a mouthy teenager's approval. That he’s still looking for it is beyond humbling and Stiles suddenly feels a little ill. His hands get clammy and his heart thumps faster in his chest.</p> <p>“If we’re doing this, I’ll find a way to keep tabs on you,” he says thickly, hoping that he’s not overstepping Derek’s boundaries. “You get one scratch when you’re not training and I’ll know and do something about it. Or Tony will, because he’s that kind of guy. Alright?”</p> <p>“Alright,” Derek agrees. The tension leaves his whole body and a small smile flirts with his lips. Stiles has never seen him this relaxed. “Thanks.”</p> <p>“We should leave,” Clint says, ending the somewhat tender moment. “Apparently Stark has made reservations and doesn’t feel like waiting for his bifteki.”</p> <p>“Greek, yum. Are you coming?” Stiles looks expectantly at Steve and Clint.</p> <p>“No, we have a mission tonight. Raincheck?” Steve replies hopefully.</p> <p>“Of course. Come back safe and we’ll have Greek together.” Stiles really, really wants the both of them to come back in one piece. He’s made his peace with Clint; he just knows that he’s a thoroughly decent guy underneath all of that snarky and suspicious exterior.</p> <p>Clint escorts them to where Tony’s car is waiting and off they are to whatever restaurant has caught Tony’s fancy now. </p> <p> <strong>End of chapter 2</strong> </p> </div> <!--/main--> </div> <!-- end of cache --> </div> </div> <!-- END work skin --> </div> <!-- END work --> <!-- BEGIN comment section --> <!-- Gets embedded anywhere we need to list comments on a top-level commentable.
