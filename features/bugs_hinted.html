Feature: bugs with hinted fields

  Scenario: hinted fields
    When I go to the homepage
    Then the "page_title" field should contain "Title"
    When I fill in "page_title" with "Something"
      And I press "Find"
      Then show me the page
    Then the "page_title" field should contain "Something"
