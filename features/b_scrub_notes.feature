Scenario: only get link if notes have content
  Given a page exists
  When I am on the page's page
  Then I should NOT see "Scrub Notes"

Scenario: remove bottom when one automatically removed surrounding div
  Given a page exists with notes: "<div><div>1st</div><div>2nd</div><div>3rd</div></div></div>"
  When I am on the page's page
    And I follow "Scrub Notes"
    And I click on "3rd" within ".bottom"
    And I press "Scrub Notes" within ".bottom"
  Then the notes should include "1st"
    And the notes should include "2nd"
    But the notes should NOT include "3rd"
